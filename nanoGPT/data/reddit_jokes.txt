They are sitting in the big pot as the cannibals are stoking the fire, adding water, potatoes, and other veggies. One of the men starts laughing.

A very rich man was infatuated with General Custer...
So he hired the world’s most famous painter to paint him a piece for the rich man’s 50th birthday. The piece was to represent General Custer’s last thoughts. The painter said of course I will do this, but no one can see the painting until the reveal at your party. The rich man agreed knowing the prestige of the painter.

The day of the party comes, and the rich man gathered every one of his friends for the reveal. The painter asks if every one was ready, and the rich man happily screams, “Of course! I’ve been waiting for months!” 

The curtain over the painting drops, and the entire painting is covered in Native Americans having sex. There is even multiple orgies  happening! 

The rich man runs to painter furious screaming, “I told you to paint General Custer’s last thoughts!” The painter, deadpan, responds, “I did exactly as you requested!” The rich man says, “What was your thinking in Custer’s last thoughts then?” The painter simply reply’s, 

“Look at all those fucking Indians!”

Three guys are captured by a tribe of cannibals
The cannibals agree to allow each of their prisoners one final request before they eat them.

The first guy requests to sleep with the most beautiful woman of the tribe. After much convening and deliberation, the cannibals allow the man to sleep with their most beautiful woman. As soon as he wakes up the next morning, he is carted off, skinned, eaten, and his hide made into a drum.

The second guy, seeing how beautiful the woman his friend got to sleep with was, requests the same thing. Again, when he wakes up the next morning, the cannibals cart him off, skin him, eat him, and turn his skin into a drum.

The third guy, after seeing the irresistible beauty of the tribe's most attractive woman, requests to see the knife used to skin his friends. 


"That's your request?" asks one of the tribal elders, "I guess if that's all you want from us before we eat you, that's fine"

The elder goes to the cooking tent and retrieves the skinning knife. He hesitates for a moment before handing it to the prisoner. As soon as the knife is in his hand, the third guy starts stabbing himself in the stomach and yells, "you assholes aren't gonna turn me into a drum!"

Couple talking a walk
A young couple is out for a romantic Valentine's Day walk along a country lane. As they walk hand in hand and as they stroll, the lad's lustful desire rises to a peak.
He is just about to get frisky when she says, "I hope you don't mind, but I really do need to take a piss." Slightly taken aback by this vulgarity, he suggests she go behind a nearby hedge.
She nods in agreement and disappears behind the shrubbery. As he waits, he can hear the sound of her tight panties rolling down her long legs and imagines what is being exposed.
Unable to contain his animal thoughts a moment longer, he reaches through a gap in the foliage, and his hand touches her leg. He quickly brings his hand further up her thigh until suddenly, and with great astonishment, he finds himself gripping a long, thick appendage that's hanging between her legs.
He shouts in horror, "My God, Claudette, I had no idea you were actually a man!"
"No, you don't understand!" she replies. "I changed my mind, I'm taking a crap instead."

He was just trying to be nice!

I need some of that water."  and goes and sits back down. Aiden says, "You want water?  OKAY!"  and brings her a cup of water.  She thanks him and Tom says, "Aiden, buddy, I need some of that water, can you get me some?"  Aiden says, "OKAY!" and runs off, getting him a water.   He says, "Thank you, thank you!"

"You want one too, daddy?" Aiden asks Sam, to which he replies "Please!"  Aiden says, "OKAY!" and comes back with another one and is thanked by his dad.

Curious and bemused, Brenda asks Aiden, "Little man, can I have some too?" and follows Aiden.  Aiden says, "OKAY!", and takes off, she smiles as he grabs a plastic cup, but does not fill it.  He goes into the bathroom and she thinks to herself, "What is he doing? Maybe he has to pee?" while she stands in the doorway.

She watches with horror as Aiden dunks the cup in the toilet and fills it.  He turns around, hands it to her, and says, "Here you go!"

A Japanese, British, and American soldier are marooned on an island inhabited by cannibals
The three soldiers are brought to the tribal Chief, who tells the men they will be killed, skinned, and their skin will be used to make canoes. But, the Chief out of respect for the men will allow them to choose their own way to die. 

The Japanese soldier asks for a sword and commits Seppuku. His body is hauled away. 

The British soldier asks for a gun, holds the gun to his head and proclaims “long live the queen!” before pulling the trigger. His body is also hauled away. 

The American soldier thinks for a second, then asks “so you want to kill us?”

“Yes” said the Chief 

“And then you’re gonna use our skin to make canoes?”

Becoming aggravated, the Chief responds “yes, yes, what’s so hard to comprehend about this?”

“Well, in that case, I’ll take a fork please”

Confused, the Chief orders his men to give the American soldier a fork. He takes a deep breath and starts stabbing his skin repeatedly yelling “fuck your canoes!!”

I wrote a joke about sheep. It's really baaad.
A farmer had two pastures, both filled with sheep. He kept the rams in one field, and the ewes in the other. He had no dog, so he taught the sheep to keep each other in check. Alternating every day, he'd let one group of sheep out, and they'd run around the others to keep them grouped together, just like a sheepdog would, before returning to their pasture at night. Not being suited for shepherding, it was very tiring for the sheep doing the work, and was stressful for the sheep being driven, too.

One day, a new ram was introduced to the flock. He thought this was a very curious arrangement. He said to one of the other rams, "Why are we in charge of keeping order amongst the ewes, and they in charge of keeping order amongst the rams? Doesn't this mutual antagonism engender animosity when mating season comes around?"

The other ram replied, "Like it or not, we always herd the ones we love."

Second one says: "I was in a restaurant in France, after eating, rather than bringing me a cheque waiter brought me an invitation to his bed."

Third woman interrupts: "That's nothing. Horniest guys live right here in our home country. Just a month ago I was walking down a street few blocks from here. I wasn't wearing any makeup or sexy clothes. And suddenly guy comes down from the sky, his dick out, yelling "Fuck me!"

An off-duty Grenadier Guardsman at a football match found himself surrounded by several Coldstream Guards...

The same thing happened in the second half, only with the other shoe.

And after the match, as they were all leaving, his bus turned up first and he got on it, and as it was about to pull out he leaned out of the window and said “Lads, lads, how long is this going to go on? This shitting in each other's shoes? This pissing in each other's Bovril?”

Once there was a man with a 15 inch penis.
He absolutely hated it, because it was too big for any woman to handle. Every time he tried to have sex, he ended up accidentally hurting his partner.
One day he went to the witch at the edge of town and asked her to help him make it smaller. "I cannot do that," said the witch, "But I do know the solution. In the forest by the pond, there is a magic purple toad. If you can get the toad to say 'No' to you, your penis will shrink by three inches."
The man followed the witch's advice, and went into the forest. Sure enough, by the lakeside was a large purple toad. The man thought for a moment, then walked up to the toad and said, "Hey magic toad, do you want to have sex with me?"
The toad replied with a disgusted face, "What? No!"
As promised, the man's penis shrunk to 12 inches! But it was still too big for him to be comfortable with, so he asked again, "Magic toad, please won't you have sex with me?" The toad once again made a face and croaked, "Ew, no!" and the man's penis shrunk to 9 inches. Still, he thought that might be too big.
"6 inches should be fine," he decided, so he went to the toad once more and said, "Magic toad, I need you to have sex with me!" to which the magic toad replied, "How many times do I have to tell you?! No! No! A thousand times no!"

An engineer, a physicist and a statistician go deer hunting.
An engineer, a physicist and a statistician go deer hunting. They see a massive buck, and the physicist gets to take the first shot.

The physicist takes out a notepad and pencil and starts calculating, "Account for coriolis force, air friction...carry the 9..." Finally the physicist has calculated the optimal firing angle.  He takes his rifle, consults his calculations, lines up and fires...but his shot is too high and goes over the buck.

This being a joke, the buck doesn't run away so it's now the engineer's turn.  He pulls out his tool kit and constructs a device to aim and fire his rifle.  He completes construction, straps his rifle in, and calibrates the machine.  The engineer then presses the fire button and steps back.  The machine whirs, then fires the rifle...but the shot is too low and passes under the deer.

The statistician throws his fists into the air and shouts, "We got him!"

My best April Fools
A long time ago, before work, I drove through the shittiest neighborhood I could find, looking for broken auto glass. I found a pile from some unfortunate soul that had their car broken into and scooped it all up.

After settling in at work, I asked to borrow my boss's keys for access to the supply closet. I then casually left the building, got in his car and moved it out of sight, and spread the glass all over the ground where his window was. And then at lunch, as he was walking out of the building, I told the office staff to look out the window and watch him get in his car. 

He walks out to where his car was, looks around confused to not see his car. He gets closer. He looks at the ground and sees the glass, and I swear we all watched his soul leave his body. His head drooped down to his feet and he walked back to the office, probably thinking he had to call the police and report a stolen car.

As soon as he opened the door, we were all standing in the hall way laughing. It took him a minute to figure it out, but he looked straight at me and gave chase yelling all kinds of obscenities. It was a fucking GREAT DAY!

A Woman gets 3 wishes...
 A woman was out golfing one day when she hit her ball into the woods. She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap. The frog said to her, "If you release me from this trap, I will grant you 3 wishes."  
The woman freed the frog.  
The frog said, "Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes that whatever you wish for, your husband will get 10 times more or better!"  
The woman said, "That would be okay."  
For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.  
The frog warned her, "You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis, that women will flock to."  
The woman replied, "That will be okay because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will only have eyes for me." So, KAZAM she's the most beautiful woman in the world!  
For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world. The frog said, "That will make your husband the richest man in the world and he will be ten times richer than you."  
The woman said, "That will be okay because what's mine is his and what's his is mine."  
So, KAZAM she's the richest woman in the world!  
The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered. "I'd like a mild heart attack."  
Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them!  
Attention female readers: This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue feeling good!  
Male readers: Please scroll down.  
The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his wife!!!  
Moral of the story: Women are really dumb but think they're really smart!

Cross-eyed Cow
One  day farmer Brown went to the barn to milk his prize cow. When he got to  the barn he was shocked to find that the cows eyes were crossed! He  thought, "This is a valuable cow, I can't have it walking around  cross-eyed." So he called the Vet.

The  vet came out and said he knew exactly what to do. He proceeded to take  out a hose and stick it in the cow's butt. He then told the farmer to go  around and watch the cow's eyes.

As  the farmer was watching the vet took a deep breath and blew into the  hose. To the farmer's amazement the cow's eyes went back to normal. The  vet said that'll be $200. The farmer was a bit taken aback by the steep  charge, but he was thankful that his cow was back to normal, so he paid  the vet without complaint.

The  next day, he went out to milk the cow as usual. To his great dismay he  found that the cow's eyes were crossed again! He didn't feel like paying  the vet again though, so he decided to treat the cow himself.

He  began to do the same procedure to the cow exactly as he saw the vet do  it the day before. However he could not see if it was having the same  effect. So he called Billy-Bob the farm hand over and said, "I want you  to watch the cow's eyes while I blow in this hose." Billy-Bob agreed and  watched as farmer Brown did the deed. However, nothing happened. He  reported to the farmer who tried it again. Still, no result.

Farmer  Brown was stumped, so he told Billy-Bob to blow while he watched the  eyes. As farmer Brown moved to the front, he saw Billy-Bob take out the  hose and turned it around! Just before he put it to his lips, the farmer  yelled, "What the hell are you doing?!"

Billy-Bob  looked at him incredulously and said, "You don't think I am gonna put  my mouth on the same end of the pipe that you had your on."

Three American colonels are in the US about to retire and they are offered an economic compensation...
..which consists of multiplying 100,000 dollars by the distance in inches they have between two parts of their body that they choose. 

Colonel McDowell chooses this distance to be from his toe to the edge of his longest hair on his head and the result is 72 inches, so that means he gets $7,200,000.

Colonel Smith chooses the reach of his arms, that is from the tip of his right index finger to the tip of his left index finger, which results in a distance of 75 inches (so he gets $7.5M).

Finally Colonel McConaughey chooses the distance from the tip of his penis to his balls

-"*Colonel, choose two parts that are more separated, you'll win more money that way!*" - says the soldier in charge of the measurement.

-"*No, i'm sure these are the parts i want measured, please proceed!*" - answers the colonel.
The soldier then proceeds to take the measuring tape from the tip of colonel's dick and stretches the tape to reach the balls when suddenly he stops and asks "*Wait...where are your balls*?!"

-"*I lost them in Vietnam*"

The spoon in a waiter's pocket catches the customer's attention
The customer asks "Why do you have a spoon in your pocket?" To which the waiter replies "It's part of a new program to save time the restaurant is doing. If I drop a soup spoon, I can quickly replace it with the spoon in my pocket, and then switch the dirty one out next time I'm in the kitchen." The customer is visibly impressed. He then notices something else. He asks "Is that the same reason you have a ketchup bottle in your apron?" The waiter says "Exactly!" The customer says "One last question. Why is there a string coming out of your fly?" The waiter explains "That string is tied to my penis. When i go pee, i just have to unzip and then give it a tug. That way, i save valuable time not having to wash my hands." The customer says "I see. But how do you get your penis back in your pants without touching it?" The waiter replies "I don't know about the other waiters, but I use my spoon."

Told this joke every summer as a camp counselor; never failed
This cheerio works 9-5 at a factory doing the same mundane task every day of every year. One day, this smoking hot frosted cheerio walks in and the normal cheerio falls for her instantly. He walks up to her and says: 

“Hey, want to grab something to eat later?” And she says:

“Actually, I’m going to this party at 8pm at this address. You should come by!”

So he finishes with work, and goes home. He tidied up, gets dressed, and gets ready for the party.

8pm rolls by, and he gets to the address. It’s got a neon sign labeled “The Joke.” He doesn’t know anyone there except for the frosted cheerio, and he just kind of wants to leave. She comes up to him and says: 

“So glad you could come! Are you having a good time?”

“Not really. I don’t know anyone here except for you. I think I’m just gonna get some punch.” He says.

“Ooh, grab me a glass, would you?” She says.

So he goes up to the table with all the drinks and snacks and such, but there isn’t anyone there. He grabs two glasses and promptly gets back to the  frosted cheerio.

“So, how’d it go?” Says the frosted cheerio.

“Smoothly. There wasn’t even a line.” He replies.

“Really?” She has a look of pure astonishment for some reason.

“Yeah. The joke doesn’t have a punchline.”

what a set up, for a dad joke. it's worth it tho
full disclosure, this isn't my joke, was sent to me 


I knew a bloke who was a massive fan of tractors his whole life.

When he was a kid, he didn't have toy cars or posters of lambos on his bedroom wall, he had toy tractors and trailers and posters of the latest John Deeres.

He didn't go on holiday to Spain, France or even the Lake District. No, his family holidays were centred around the agricultural shows, especially the Great Yorkshire Show and the Appleby Show.

Sometimes, the tractor salesmen would even let him go for a ride on a tractor while they moved them about the ground!

As he grew up, his love for tractors never waned or faded, and was just as strong on his wedding day as when he was a child, to the point, he didn't have wedding cars, but tractors!

On his honeymoon, he and his new wife travelled north to stay at Appleby Manor Hotel and go to the show, telling everyone that they were honeymooning.

One of the salesmen, who'd known him for years, asked if he'd like to drive his new wife around the showground in the newest machine.

Obviously, he leapt at the chance! To take control of a tractor? This was a dream come true!

So, he and his wife climbed aboard and he drove a full circuit of the ground, loving every single second.

Of course, it couldn't last forever and all too soon, they got back to the salesman. They jumped down and thanked the salesman gratefully. The salesman asked if they'd like a photo with the tractor. Of course, they said yes and they stood next to the tractor, he with his hand on the step in front of the big wheel and his wife to the outside.

Unknown to anyone, he had forgotten to put the handbrake on and a sudden gust of wind, combined with the slight incline the tractor was on caused it to roll forward.

Before anyone realised what was happening, he'd slipped on the grass and the big wheel had run straight over him.

The Great North Air Ambulance service was in attendance and flew him straight to the Cumberland Infirmary at Carlisle. Nearly every bone in his body was broken, several of organs were damaged and he had huge internal bleeding.

It took hours of surgery to stabilise his condition, followed by a medically induced coma lasting several weeks and repeated surgical treatments to realign bones and repair what damage they could.

He then was put into an intense physiotherapy regime to teach him to walk and rebuild the strength he had lost over the past six months.

Obviously, all this time in the hospital gave him a lot of time to think about his life and he came to the realisation that being such a huge fan of tractors had been a massive waste of time and had, in the end, cost him a lot more than it had ever been worth. He vowed, silently, to leave his obsession behind and move on with a more normal life.

As he laid in his hospital bed, day after day, week after week, month after month, subsisting on the hospital food and whatever his beloved and devoted wife bought to him, he realised that when he got out of there, what he really fancied was a proper pie and a pint in a proper pub.

So when the day came, and he was finally discharged from the loving care of the infirmary, he hurpled on his stick across the road to the pub he'd seen. He got his pint from the bar, ordered a steak and ale pie with creamy mash, peas and gravy and took a seat at a table next to the window.

He was sipping away, soaking up the ambiance and listening to the old man at the end of the bar put the world to rights, when the door to the kitchen flew open and a huge billow of smoke plumed into the bar and filled the room.

Everyone was panicking, trying to get out of the pub, but not my mate.

He just calmly stood up, using the table for support and opened the window. He turned his head into the smoke and inhaled deeply, turned back to the window and blew out. He did this twice more and the smoke was gone.

Everyone just stopped and looked at him. After a moment the bartender spoke, “How the fuck did you do that???”

“Easy,” replied my friend, as he took his seat and picked up his pint, “I'm an ex tractor fan.”

Surprise
Once there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked 
beans. She loved them but unfortunately, they had always had a very 
embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. 

Then one day she met a man and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, "He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on." 
She made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. 

Some months ater her car broke down on the way home from work. 
Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. 
So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. 

All the way home she putt-putted, and upon arriving home she 
felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, "Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight." He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. 

She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the telephone. 

The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the 
pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband 
was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. 

She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage. 

Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the telephone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. 

She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. 

At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!! 
There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish 
her a "Happy Birthday"!!!

Wedding
The wedding date was set and the groom's three pals - a carpenter, an electrician and a dentist were deciding what pranks to play on the couple on their wedding night.

The carpenter figured sawing the slats of their bed would give them a chuckle or two.

The electrician decided to wire the bed - with alternating current, of course.

The dentist wouldn't commit himself, but wore a sly grin and promised it would be memorable.

The nuptials went as planned and a few days later, each of the grooms buddies received the following note:

"Dear Friends, we didn't mind the bed slats being sawed. The electric shock was only a minor setback. But I swear by God Almighty, I'm going to kill whoever put novocaine in the condom!"

3 young men were lost in the desert without any food and water.
After almost a full day of trying to find their way out, they stumbled across a small house.  The 3 young men decided to see if there was any way they could get any help, including some drinks and a meal.  After knocking on the door, the ugliest, most wrinkly, stinkiest women answered the door.

Man #1: “So sorry to interrupt you this evening, but my two friends and I are stranded in this desert.  Could we possibly use your phone and have a snack and some water"

Lady: “Of course.  I would be happy to help you handsome young me out! I actually just brewed some tea and made meatloaf.  But first, one of you guys has to fuck me.”

The 3 young men looked at each other, almost vomiting at the idea of sticking their dick inside this vile woman.

Man #1: “I’m sorry ma’am, but I have a girl friend.”
He walks away, tapping his friends shoulder.

Man #2: “Yeah.  I’m gay so I won’t be able to get hard.”
He walks away, joining his other friend.

Man #3: “I will do it.  But you have to wear a blindfold.”

Lady: “That’s just fine sweetie. Come on in.”

Man #3 walks inside with the Lady while his other two friends stick outside.  The ugly lady undresses, puts a blindfold on, and hands him a condom.  He takes a corn on the cob from the pantry and inserts it into the lady, using it as a dildo.  The lady screams and moans while the man is trying not to gag from the smell.  After she orgasms, he throws the corn on the cob out of the window and stuffs the unused condom in his pocket.  

Lady: “Wow that was absolutely amazing.  Here is some meatloaf and a thermos of iced tea.  My phone is on the countertop right over there”

After making some phone calls to his family and checking the gps to figure out how to get home, he walks outside with the meatloaf and some cold tea and walks around the corner of the house to find his friends.

Man #3: “Hey guys, look how good this meatloaf looks!”

Man #2: “Man, I don’t know about you. But we just shared the best buttered corn in our lives!”

One time I had a kid come over to my house and tell me that my house was small and boring. So then I told him that my house was small because I had an amazing secret basement full of games and toys that I never tell anyone about. This kid wanted to see it really badly at that point, so I told him to wait outside the basement door so I could get the games and toys ready for him. I took a bucket of glitter mixed in with super glue and set it up on the top of the basement door. I gave the kid the cue to come inside, and when he opened the door, I stabbed him.

A high school girl decides she wants extra cash to buy clothes
She walks all over town trying to find a job for someone her age. She meets three men. 

The first man is short, stocky, and has a red beard. He offers her a job gutting fish. She wrinkles her pretty nose and says no thank you, I don’t like the smell.

The second man has a purple jumpsuit on and black adidas. He offers her a job coaching a middle school track team. She wrinkles her pretty nose and says no thank you, I don’t like the smell. 

The third man is tall and skinny, wearing a big trench coat and with a greasy slicked down mustache. He offers her a job doing kinky knee videos for a very niche crowd of viewers. She has a very pretty set of knees so she agrees.

She excels tremendously at her job and within weeks has hundreds of guys paying her for simple videos of her knees! The only issue is, she’s up all night making them. She can’t sleep.

She comes down for breakfast one day with black bags under her eyes and her dad says “honey, you absolutely need to get some sleep.”

The Gates of Heaven
Three friends Thomas, Arthur, and Frank die and go to heaven. When they reach the Pearly Gates, St. Peter greets them and tells them that due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, God asked him to limit the number of people entering Heaven.

The three friends were sad realizing that all three will not be together anymore, so they ask him how are you going to choose who among us will go through the gates? To which St Peter replied, " If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don’t know or cannot answer, then you’re worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you’ll go straight to Hell.”  The three friends agreed.

Thomas stepped in first. He was a philosopher so he said, “OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates’ Socrates’ teachings.”   With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to St Peter. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. “Then, you are going to Hell!”

Arthur was next.  He was a mathematician so he asked, "Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!”    With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to St Peter. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct.  “Then, you are going to Hell!”

Finally, Frank stepped in. He asked St peter to bring him a chair and he brought forward a chair. Frank asked him to drill 20 holes on the chair, he did just that. 

Frank then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, “Which hole did my fart come out from?” 

St. Peter inspected the seat and said, "The third hole from the top-right.”

“Wrong,” said Frank, “It’s wrong.”

 “It came out from my asshole.” 

And Frank went to Heaven.

Lost (Limerick and Joke)
There once was a man who was always lost.

He would buy a map at any cost.

One day on a trip,

he heard his map rip,

so into a trashcan, he tossed.



He wandered and wandered with no aim.

He started to think it was a game.

But with no end in sight

and quickly losing light,

he started back the way he came.



He cried and threw his hands in the air;

he screamed and shouted with despair.

"Could anyone help?"

Then he started with a yelp.

There was another man, but trust him, he dare?



"I gotchu," the man said with a grin.

"Come on, I'll help you, hop in."

He got in his car,

they drove pretty far:

for the traveler, it seemed a big win.



The driver took the man to a club:

he assumed there'd be a phone at a pub.

So, in the men went,

and a message to his wife, the traveler sent.

Then at a deli next door, they ordered a sub.



Suddenly thirsty, the traveler got,

so back to the club for drinks, he sought.

He was bad at navigating,

the driver was hating,

but he pressed on, getting lost quite a lot.



At last, he found the club just fine,

but he didn't want a beer or wine.

He pushed through the crowd,

 and yelled out quite loud, 

"Hey man, where's the punchline?"

EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND
If you have a grief nobody feels, If you have a pain nobody feels. If your heart is broken nobody feels, but if you fart all will understand.

Little Boy

A kindergarten class had a homework assignment to find out about something exciting and relate it to the class the next day. When the time came to present what they'd found, the first little boy walked up to the front of the class made a small white dot on the blackboard and sat back down. Puzzled, the teacher asked him just what it was. 

"It's a period,'' said the little boy.

"Well, I can see that,'' she said, ''but what is so exciting about a period?''

''Darned if I know,'' said the little boy, ''but this morning my sister was missing one, Daddy had a heart attack, Mommy fainted, and the man next door shot himself."

Game Warden
Three blondes are sitting by the side of a river holding fishing poles with the lines in the water.
A Game Warden comes up behind them, taps them on the shoulder and says, “Excuse me, ladies, I’d like to see your fishing licenses.”
“We don’t have any,” replied the first blonde.
“Well, if you’re going to fish, you need fishing licenses,” said the Game Warden.
“But officer,” replied the second blonde, “we aren’t fishing. We all have magnets at the end of our lines and we’re collecting debris off the bottom of the river.”
The Game Warden lifted up all the lines and, sure enough, there were horseshoe magnets tied on the end of each line. “Well, I know of no law against it,” said the Game Warden. “Take all the debris you want.” And with that, he left. As soon as the Game Warden was out of sight, the three blondes started laughing hysterically. “What a dumb Fish Cop,” the second blonde said to the other two. “Doesn’t he know that there are steelhead trout in this river?”

3 Engineers
3 Engineers are discussing God and the human body. 

The first Engineer says God has to be an Electrical Engineer, who else could wire up such a complicated system?

The second Engineer says God has to be a Structural Engineer, who else could build such a strong and sturdy frame?

The third Engineer says you are both wrong. God IS a Civil Engineer, who else would run a sewer line through a recreational area?!

A little old lady sold pretzels on the corner for fifty cents each
  

A little old lady sold pretzels on the street corner for fifty cents each. Every day, a young lawyer would exit his office building at lunch, and as he passed her pretzel stand, he'd leave two quarters. However, he never took a pretzel.

This went on for nearly five years. 

Even though they never spoke, every day he'd leave fifty cents, they'd make eye contact, and she would nod her gratitude as he walked away without a pretzel.

Finally one day, as the lawyer passed her stand and laid down his two quarters, the pretzel woman spoke to him.

"Sir, I appreciate your business. You are my best customer, but you need to know something. The price of pretzels has gone up to seventy-five cents."

Testing trouble.
Two young engineers applied for a single position at a computer company. They both had the same qualifications. In order to determine which individual to hire, the applicants were asked to take a test by the Department manager. 

Upon completion of the test, both men missed only one of the questions. The manager went to the first applicant and said, "Thank you for your interest, but we've decided to give the job to the other applicant." 

"And why would you be doing that? We both got 9 questions correct," asked the rejected applicant. 

"We have based our decision not on the correct answers, but on the question you missed," said the Department manager. 

"And just how would one incorrect answer be better than the other?" the rejected applicant inquired. 

"Simple," said the Department manager, "Your fellow applicant put down on question #5, 'I don't know.' You put down, 'Neither do I.'"

The Engineer sat up straight and said, "Wow! Are you kidding?"

I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree. And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.”

Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said “In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.”

His parents replied “We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior. We’ve tried everything.”

Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.” The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed. Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.

Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard. After a while his parents asked him sarcastically “So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?”

Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said “I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!”

Heather came across an article about an African tribe that practiced body mod. Specifically, they hung weights on their men's cocks, and they averaged 20 inches long.  There were pictures. 

"You know," Bill said, "I could do that.  While you're in Europe this summer, I'll put weights on my cock and stretch it out for you."  Heather agreed that would be hot.

In mid-July, Heather called Bill. "How's our anthropology project going?"

Jim asks a villager, "There are no women? How do you live without sex?"

The villager points to a horse and says, "Oh, we just use that horse over there."

Jim, now absolutely revolted, walks away in disgust. He thinks to himself, "God! These barbarians are practicing bestiality! How terrible!"

However, after months of living in the village, the horse looks more and more attractive. One day, the man can't take it anymore and asks the head of the village if he can use the horse for sex. The leader agrees, and so he sends a team of volunteers, headed by Jim, to use the horse.

As they approach the horse, Jim takes off his pants and starts boinking this horse.

"**What are you doing?**" exclaimed the rest of the team, "We don't fuck the horse; we ride it to the next town over!"

 An American from Michigan is visiting Canada. He stops to see his sister in Toronto, then flies out west to Calgary. He is quite taken with the Canadian Rockies, the friendliness of the Canadian people, and the over all wonderful attitude. He decides he wants to write a letter back to his sister in Toronto to tell her all about it. He writes the letter, heads down to Canada Post and is absolutely shocked when they tell him it is $1.07 for a stamp.

Later that evening, he is out at a bar and gets to talking with one of the locals:

"This is a great country you have here, but I have to admit, it was some serious sticker shock to have to buy a stamp for $1.07! Did you know that in the USA it only costs fifty five cents to send a letter?"

The Canadian looks at him and replies, "Actually, it only costs fifty five cents to mail a letter here in Canada, too."

"But the charged me a dollar seven!" exclaims the American.

"Yeah," says the Canadian, "the other fifty two cents is for storage."

The peculiar tale of Hyman Goldfarb
During one of my many trips to London, I became friends with a very wealthy, yet very modest, Jewish chap named Hyman Goldfarb.

On one visit, Hy told me that because of his large donations to charities through the years, the queen wanted to knight him, but he was going to turn it down.

"That's a great honor," I said. "Why would you turn it down?"

"Because during the ceremony you have to say something in Latin," he said. "And I don't wish to bother studying Latin just for that."

"So say something in Hebrew. The queen wouldn't know the difference."

"Brilliant," Hy complimented me, "but what should I say?"

Remember that question the son asks the father on the first night of Passover? ... Can you say that in Hebrew?"

"Of course," he said. "Ma nishtana ha laila hazeh.

Thank you, old sport, I shall become a knight."

At the ceremony Hy waited his turn while several of the other honorees went before the queen. Finally they called his name. He knelt before Her Majesty, she placed her sword on one shoulder and then on the other, and motioned for Hy to speak. Out came "Ma nishtana ha laila hazeh."

The queen turned to her husband and said, "Why is this knight different from all the other knights?"

A couple from London, John, Sarah and their 6 year old son Jimmy, win £8 million on the lottery and they decide to fulfill their lifelong dream - to quit the rat race and buy a farm with animals in the countryside. 

They eventually find the property of their dreams and make arrangements to buy it, along with with a wide array of farm animals. A few months later, when they are settled in, they decide to invite the local vicar and his wife around for Sunday lunch in an effort to get to know their neighbours. 

Before the meal, John, Sarah, the vicar and his wife were sitting around the kitchen table talking, when the door suddenly flew open and in rushed Jimmy shouting "mum, dad, the bull is f**cking the cow!" John and Sarah were horrified and embarrassed that their guests should hear such coarse language. They both apologised profusely to the vicar and his wife and asked if lunch could be postponed to the following Sunday. 

Meanwhile, John and Sarah took Jimmy to one side and said, "Jimmy, it would have been so much better if you had told us that the bull was 'surprising' the cow instead of using the word you did".

Next Sunday, just as before, the couple, as well as the vicar and his wife were sitting chatting before lunch, when again the door burst suddenly open and in rushed Jimmy breathlessly announcing "mum, dad, the bull is surprising all the cows", "He can't be surprising all the cows" said his mother, "He is mum" said Jimmy," He's f**cking the horse!".

Religion in a nutshell.
A ship, sailing past a small island spots a man who'd been stranded there for several years. The captain goes ashore to rescue the man and notices 3 huts.

"What's the first hut?" He asks.

"Oh, that's my home." The man answers.

"What's the second hut?" The captain asks.

"Oh, that's my church." The man answers.

"Well, what's the third hut?" The captain asks.

“Oh, that?” sniffs the castaway disdainfully. “That’s the church I used to go to.”

Chinese medicine
The Brit expat couple had great jobs in Hong Kong, but after at time the man noted a problem.  His wife seemed less interested in having sex with him.  He went to see an ancient Chinese man, a practitioner of Confucian holistic medicine.

"So simple," the sage said.  "Rule of nine.  Make move nine times, then change.  Plant jade stalk in flowering lotus hard and fast, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9.  Then pause for count of nine.  Then do oh-so-slow for nine.  Than pause .  Then change position from on top to on side.  Same.  Than change from on side to like doggies.  Then same.  Keep up for 90 minutes. Do this, she go wild for you."

The Brit paid the sage, went home, and tried it.  As promised, his wife went wild.  At the end she rolled over, sweaty, limp, and half conscious, and asked her adoring husband "Herbert, that was fantastic.

Don't Lie to Your Mom
**Could have been posted before**, however here it goes...



Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Kumar and his roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, Kumar volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Sunita and I are just roommates."

About a week later, Sunita came to Kumar saying, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" Kumar said, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure."

So he sat down and wrote :

\----------------------

*Dear Mother:*

*I'm not saying that you 'did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the silver plate. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.*

*Love, Kumar*

\----------------------

Several days later, Kumar received an email from his Mother which reads :

\----------------------

*Dear Son:*

*I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Sunita, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Sunita. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now under the pillow.*

*Love, Mom.*

The British Minister for Agriculture was entertaining a leading American agronomist.
Looking over the production figures from the USA, the Minister was moved to comment: "Your tomato harvest is immense. What on earth do you do with so many tomatos?". The American smiled broadly and answered "Well, sir, we eat what we can, and what we can't eat, we can!". The Minister laughed along and said "Oh, very witty, I must tell the Prime Minister when I see him."

So later that day, at a meeting of the Cabinet, the Minister remarked, "You know, sir, I was talking to this American chappie about the fearful amount of tomatoes they grow, and you'll never guess what he said. He said they eat as much as they are able, and whatever is left over, they put up in tins!"

An alien visit...long
So a couple was playing cards one night when a spaceship landed in their yard. The aliens ended up knocking on the door so the humans let them inside. The aliens explained they were just visiting earth to see how an average earthly couple lived. They began playing cards and drinking, having a good time. Well the two ladies excused themselves to the restroom. The men started talking and decided to swap partners to see what it was like. After talking with the women they retired to separate bedrooms. The earth lady and alien man were together as he undressed. She start laughing saying it will never work because it’s too small, the alien says no problem just twist my left ear and it gets as long as you want, she said that great but still too thin, he says just twist on the other ear and it gets as thick as you want. So they have sex everything is great. The next day the aliens leave and the earth male asks his wife how it was, she says it was awesome!  She asks how was yours?  He say it was ok but that bitch almost twisted my ears off!!!

Donald Trump goes on a fact-finding visit to Israel.
While he is on a tour of Jerusalem he suffers a heart attack and dies. The undertaker tells the American diplomats accompanying him:  "You can have him shipped home for $50,000, or you can bury him here, in the Holy Land, for just $100.”
 
The American diplomats go into a corner to discuss for a few minutes. They return with their answer to the undertaker and tell him they want Donald Trump shipped home. The undertaker is puzzled and asks, "Why would you spend $50,000 to ship him home, when it would be wonderful to be buried here and you would spend only $100?”
 
The American diplomats reply, "Long ago a man died here, was buried here, and three days later he rose from the dead. We just can't take that risk.”

Blind man and a pigeon
So a blind man is walking down a street and a pigeon spots him. The pigeon says to himself "Ima get him gooooood". So, the pigeon prepares himself, and dives head first down to the blind man and drops his s*#t. The blind man just does swish, swoosh, and avoids shat.

Now, this irritated the pigeon but he doesn't think much of it. He prepared another 'batch' and of he dives again. Releases the s*&amp;t and the blind man, again, swoosh swish, avoids the poop.

Now this really riles up the pigeon. He told himself he needs to go all out and calls his pigeon friends. And he really does. Thousands upon thousands pigeons flying in a carpet formation and letting they're s=@t go on that poor blind man. The blind man, once again does just swish swish, swoosh swoosh and manages to avoid all the unholy substance.

A guy walks into a bar at 4:30 one afternoon.
He's enjoying his drink and talking with the bartender.  

At 4:57 the bartender looks at the clock and says, "Damn.  I lost track of the time, I gotta get busy."  The bartender quickly makes a drink and sets it on the bar.  

Precisely at 5:00 pm, a well-dressed man walks into the bar, grabs the drink and gulps it down.  He leaves a $10 bill on the bar and exits without saying a word.

The guy who came in at 4:30 looks at the bartender and asks, "What the hell was that all about?"

The bartender explained, "He's a surgeon, and he comes in every day at 5:00 pm, after his work is through.  He always orders an almond daiquiri, and leaves me a nice tip.  He's done this for so long, I know what to expect.  And he's a buys man, so I don't want to keep him waiting.  I make sure his drink is ready before he comes in."

The guy seemed impressed by the bartender's efficiency.  He came back the next few days at 4:30, and watched as the bartender made an almond daiquiri for the surgeon.  And every day, the surgeon came in precisely at 5:00 pm, drank the daiquiri, and left without saying a word.

One afternoon, the bartender started to make the drink, but realized he was out of almonds.  "What am I going to do?" he asked himself as he searched throughout the bar for almonds.  He found some hickory nuts, and figured that the surgeon wouldn't notice the difference.  So, he mixed up the drink with the hickory nuts, and placed in at the end of the bar.

Sure enough, at 5:00 pm, the surgeon walked into the bar and picked up his drink.  With one sip, he knew something was amiss and he said, "What's going on?  This isn't my usual drink."

The bartender said, "Well, that's a hickory daiquiri, doc."

a blind man walks into a restaurant
A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down. The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu. “I’m sorry, sir, but I am blind and can’t read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer. I’ll smell it and order from there.” A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man’s table and hands it to him. The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath. “Ah, yes, that’s what I’ll have — meatloaf and mashed potatoes.” Unbelievable, the owner thinks as he walks towards the kitchen. The cook happens to be the owner’s wife. He tells her what had just happened. The blind man eats his meal and leaves. Several days later, the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again. “Sir, remember me? I’m the blind man.” “I’m sorry, I didn’t recognize you. I’ll go get you a dirty fork.” The owner retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man. After another deep breath, the blind man says, “That smells great. I’ll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli.” Walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he’s going to test him. The blind man eats and leaves. He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen. He tells his wife, “Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man.” Mary complies and hands her husband the fork. As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting. “Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you.” The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff, and says, “Hey I didn’t know that Mary worked here…”

So there was this man who wanted to be a train conductor (Long)
So he works really hard at it and one day his dream came true. He was driving his train one day when he got distracted and he crashed killing one passenger. In his country the punishment for this is the electric chair. So they strap him up and then asked if he had a last wish. He asked for 1 banana. Well it was a strange request but they still honored it. After he ate his banana they turned the machine on they heard it zap but the conductor was still fine. It was weird but they just let it go. A year or 2 later he somehow managed to get his job back and was driving the train again and, what do you know he crashed. But this time he killed 2 passengers. Well the trial happened he was getting the electric chair again and they strap him up again and then asked if he had a last wish. He asked for 2 bananas this time. they thought that it was a really strange request but they still honored it. After he ate his bananas they turned the machine on they heard it zap but the conductor was still fine. It was weird but they just let it go. So about 5 years later he managed to get his job back yet again. He is driving again and crashed yet again. Trial happened again he was sentenced to death by the chair again. they strap him up and then asked if he had a last wish. He asked for 3 bananas. This time the executioner yells NO BANANAS THIS TIME and turns on the machine. And what do you know the conductor lived. The executioner asks the conductor, "how do you still live?" The conductor replies "I guess I am just a bad conductor".

A magician was working on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.
 The audience was different each week so he did the same tricks over and over. The problem was, the captain's parrot saw all the shows and began to understand how the magician did every trick.

He started shouting in the middle of the show: 'Look, it's not the same hat. Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table. Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?' The magician was furious but, as it was the captain's parrot, he could do nothing. Then one day the ship sank and the magician found himself floating on a piece of wood with the parrot.

They glared at each other but said nothing. Finally, after a week, the parrot said: 'OK, I give up. Where's the boat?'

As a crowded airliner is about to take off
 As a crowded airliner is about to take off, the peace is shattered by a  5-year-old boy who picks that moment to throw a wild temper tantrum. No  matter what his frustrated, embarrassed mother does to try to calm him  down, the boy continues to scream furiously and kick the seats around  him.  
 

Suddenly, from the rear of the plane, an elderly  man in the uniform of an Air Force General is seen slowly walking  forward up the aisle. Stopping the flustered mother with an upraised  hand, the white-haired, courtly, soft-spoken General leans down and,  motioning toward his chest, whispers something into the boy's ear.  
 

Instantly, the boy calms down, gently takes his mother's hand, and  quietly fastens his seat belt. All the other passengers burst into  spontaneous applause.  
 

As the General slowly makes his way back to his seat, one of the cabin  attendants touches his sleeve. "Excuse me, General," she asks quietly,  "but could I ask you what magic words you used on that little boy?"  
 

The old man smiles serenely and gently confides, "I showed him my  pilot's wings, service stars, and battle ribbons, and explained that  they entitle me to throw one passenger out the plane door on any flight I choose.

Three nurses working in a morgue discover a dead man with a hard on.
The 1st nurse says "I can't let that go to waste." She rides him. The 2nd nurse does the same. The 3rd nurse hesitates and explains that she is on her period but rides him anyway. Then the man sits up and the nurses apologies saying they thought he was dead. The man replies "I was, but after two jump starts and a blood transfusion, I'm feeling great!"

A frog goes into a bank
A frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He can see from her nameplate that her name is Patty Whack.

"Miss Whack, I'd like to get a $30,000 loan to take a holiday."

Patty looks at the frog in disbelief and asks his name. The frog says his name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it's okay, he knows the bank manager.

Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral.

The frog says, "Sure. I have this," and produces a tiny porcelain elephant, about an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.

Very confused, Patty explains that she'll have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office.

She finds the manager and says, "There's a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $30,000, and he wants to use this as collateral." She holds up the tiny pink elephant. "I mean, what in the world is this?"

The bank manager looks back at her and says, "It's a knickknack, Patty Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone."

Senior Sex
Senior Sex --

The husband leans over and asks his wife, "Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you."
Yes, she says, "I remember it well."

OK, he says, "How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?"

"Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!"

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having
sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, "Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?"

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

"Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence."

A horse is watching the music channel,
He's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says "that looks amazing, I want to do that!"
The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. "Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar." Says the horse.
"Sure," says the man on the phone. "Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."
"There's just one problem," says the horse. "I'm a horse."
"Not to worry," the man says. "We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."
Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.
"Hey Chicken, come over!" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says "hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that."
Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. "Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums." Says the chicken.
"Sure," says the man on the phone. "Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."
"There's just one problem," says the chicken. "I'm a chicken."
"Not to worry," the man says. "We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."
Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.
Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. "Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar." Says the cow.
"Sure," says the man on the phone. "Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."
"There's just one problem," says the cow. "I'm a cow."
"Not to worry," the man says. "We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."
Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.
One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says "hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!"
The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.
Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.
Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.
So the horse walks into a bar.
The bartender asks, "why the long face?"

Donald Trump thinks very hard. He is thinking for 1 hour, for 2 hour, for 3 hours. He finaly says:

-I have no idea. 

The girl smiles and says:

-Then how do you want to talk about important things like politics or global warming, when you don't even know about a shit?

Jesus and Moses
Jesus and Moses were sitting up in heaven in the late 70s early 80s looking down on the beaches of California. Jesus says, “Damn Moses, I’m bored.” Moses says,”Me too. it looks like they are having a good time. Let’s go down.”  
So they go down and are walking along the beach with their long hair and flowing robes and they just blend in.

Jesus says, “Damn Moses I don’t understand, the last time I was down here people would gather around and praise me.” Moses said, “I know me too. Watch this I’ll show them.”  
He walks over, grabs a frisbee And throws it out in the ocean. Walk up to the water, raises his hands and parts the water. He walks out picks up the frisbee, walks back to shore and everyone says, “ Yeah Moses.”  
Jesus says that’s pretty good Moses, but watch this.” He grabs the frisbee, throws it out in the ocean, takes off running across the water and just sinks.  
Moses walks up to water, raises his hands, parts the water, pulls Jesus up on shore, and pumps the water out of him. Jesus wakes up looks at Moses and says,”I don’t understand Moses, the last time I was down here I used to do this all the time.”  
Moses says, “SURE JUSES, BUT THAT’S BEFORE YOU HAD THE HOLES IN YOUR FEET.”

One of the students requested his teacher that he wanted to talk to him after class
  

Teacher: - "What do you want to talk about?"

Student: - "I think I'm intelligent enough and I should be in a higher class. Can you send me to a higher class?"

The teacher delivered her request to the school director, and the director conducted an interview to assess the student's ability.

Director: - "How much is 3 by 4?"

Student: - "12".

Director: - "Well, how much is 6 by 6?"

Student: - "36".

Director: - "Where is Japan's capital?"

Student: - "Tokyo"

The director questioned for about half an hour and the student made no mistake in answering once.

Then he said to Teacher that if you want to ask anything you can ask.

Teacher: - "Okay, so what is that thing that cows have four and I have two?"

(The director looked at Teacher with surprise).

Student: - "Legs!"

Teacher: - "Exactly, now tell me what's in your pants and not in my pants?"

(Director was shocked and embarrassed).

Student: - "pocket"

Teacher: - "Where do women have curly hair?"

(The director is shocked).

Student: - "In Africa"

Teacher: - "What is the soft thing that becomes hard in the hands of women?"

(The director's heartbeat stopped).

Student: - "Nail polish".

Teacher: - "What is between the legs of women and men?" (Director mumbles).

Student: - "Knees"

Teacher: - "Awesome! Now tell me what is it that a married woman has bigger than a virgin girl?"

(The director's body is dead).

Student: - "A Bed".

Teacher: - "What is the place in my body that causes the highest moisture on the planet?"

(The director looked up at the sky and started shouting to God).

Parrot
It's a woman and it's her birthday, so she decides to go out and buy herself a parrot. She goes to a lot of stores, but she can't find one. Disappointed, she decides to go home. Finally, she sees a pet store where she hasn't been yet so she goes to see if she can find a parrot there. She goes to see the salesman and asks him if he has a parrot. 

"No, sorry, I don't."

"But I see one at the back of your shop, it's got a bit of a strange face but well..."

"It's not for sale, it'll get you in trouble."

"I don't care, it's my birthday, I absolutely want one!"

"Well, OK, but he grew up in a brothel, so he's a bit vulgar."

So she buys the parrot and goes home. Then she gets ready to go out to celebrate her birthday with some friends and when she gets to the front door, the parrot starts talking.

"Hey bitch! You're gonna get fucked tonight, aren't you? Bitch..."

She doesn't pay attention to him and leaves. She comes home at 4am and the parrot says to her.

"So bitch? Did you get fucked good?"

She's tired, so she's going to bed. She wakes up the next day and goes to breakfast. There the parrot talks to her again.

"Hey bitch! You're walking funny today, you got fucked really good last night, didn't you? Fucking slut..."

She finally gets mad and goes back to the store where she bought the parrot. She asks the clerk if he has a solution to calm the parrot down.

"I might have something that could work. It's a special black paint, it'll shut him up."

So she goes home and as usual the parrot greets her.

"Hey bitch!"

She takes the paint and paints it black. Then he says nothing more. After a week without him saying anything she goes to him and says.

"Well, asshole? You don't talk now, do you?"

"When I'm in a tuxedo, I don't talk to bitches."

Engineers take a bow!
During the development of a new jet fighter aircraft the wings on the prototypes kept snapping off where they joined the fuselage. The test-pilots who only barely survived by ejecting in time were terrified. No amount of re-design seem to solve the problem, so the aircraft company in desperation offered its employees a huge reward to come up with diagnoses. To the surprise of the top engineers, old Jenkins the janitor meekly said he had an idea. Well, desperation breeds opportunities, so they asked him to explain. In reply he merely requested a power drill, and when supplied one he climbed onto the wings of the latest prototype and proceeded to make holes a few inches apart where the wings joined the fuselage. "Now, get your test pilot to fly the fighter", Jenkins advised. Sceptical, but curious, the engineers did. Lo! The jet fighter passed with flying (pun intended) colors. No more wing snapping. Amazed, the engineers surrounded Jenkins amidst all the celebration and asked him how he had hit upon such a clever solution that evaded all the engineering brains. Here is Jenkins' response.

African chief whose obsession was to conquer other chiefs and take their thrones as trophies
There was this African chief at the turn of the last century whose obsession was to conquer other chiefs and take their thrones as trophies. These thrones he would collect and display in the second level of his magnificent palace just above his own luxurious throne. This palace was renowned for its construction that was in keeping with the best of tradition - everything was made of grass and leaves.

One day, the chief was on his throne receiving some ambassadors when the trophy thrones above him proved to be too heavy and the straw paltform collapsed. The thrones fell on him, and sad to say, he joined his ancestors in the happy hunting grounds.

Which just goes to show that people who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.

There’s an unusual hospital
where one of the treatments involves the female nurses taking the male patients home and sleeping with them.

For most of the patients, the treatment is very effective. But one day, into the hospital comes an odd patient who has the word “Shorty” tattooed on his penis. None of the nurses want anything to do with him.

Days go by and the poor man’s health doesn’t improve. So finally, this one nurse feels sorry for him and brings him home.

When she comes in the next morning, she is smiling and happy. The other nurses ask, “Why are you so happy? Weren’t you with the guy who has ‘Shorty’ tattooed on his penis?”

“Yes,” she says, “but when he became aroused, it said ‘Shorty’s Restaurant and Pizzeria.’”

How to make your wife scream

The Indian man says, "Well last week my wife and I had sex too. I rubbed her body all over with coconut oil, we made love, and she screamed for 6 hours.  

The Italian and Frenchman were stunned.  They asked, "What could you have possibly done to make your wife scream for 6 hours?"   
He shrugs. "I wiped my hands on the curtains ."

A family were having dinner...
All of a sudden, the 5yo daughter says:

"grandpa is going to die" 

Nobody takes her seriously, and they go to bed. In the middle of the night, the hospital calls to tell the father that his own father died. Strange coincidence.

The next day, the family is having dinner again, and this time, the little girl says:

"Grandma is going to die"

Surely enough, in the middle of the night, the phone rings to announce the passing of the mother of the father.
The dad is getting nervous, and when he hears his daughter say: 

"My father is going to die"

He shits himself and spends the night writing goodbyes to his family and friends and hugging his wife for his final moments.
Then the phone rings.
The dad picks it up and asks what is wrong:

"Your brother died"

“Why would you do that!?”, the wife asked.

“They announced on the news this morning the symptoms for corona virus. One of them is having no sense of taste. Just look at that guy!” Proclaimed the husband.

“What are you...” the wife began to say when she noticed the guy in question was wearing crocs. She gasped and ran out of the store as fast as her legs could take her.

A few days later the third lady finds her way to the pharmacy. “Excuse me, can I have some condoms please?” She askes the pharmacist. “Of course,” he replies. “Do you know what size you need?” The lady thinks for a moment then replies, “big enough for a camel.”

Two guys were walking through a field when they came across a big hole in the ground. One said how deep do you think this hole is? The other guy says don’t know, let’s throw a rock down there then listen to see how long it takes to hit bottom. So they threw a rock in and never heard it hit.... we need a bigger rock to hear it so they found a big rock ..... still nothing. Looking around they found a railroad tie and said surely we will here that hit bottom so they both struggled and heaved into the hole, while waiting to hear it hit bottom this goat came running up right in between them and jumped into the hole.  They were freaking out when a man walked up and asked, have you seen a goat around here? They were like yeah one just ran up and jumped down that hole. The man said no that couldn’t be mine ....  I had mine tied to a railroad tie

An old proverb
Benny gets engaged to a woman and her father tells him he wants to talk to him.

"What do you want?" Benny asks.

"Well, I wanted you to know that you can't shave until you get  married or you'll be turned into a vase."

Benny thinks it's a little weird, but he wants to honor what his future father-in-law believes in. As time goes on though he thinks about shaving so he'll look nice for his wedding, but he doesn't. Finally, the day of the wedding comes and he decides he HAS to shave. He does and he gets turned into a vase.

Do you know the moral?

A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.

Due to an issue with the union, they couldn't swap the two until the next day, and the Pope had to spend the night in Hell, while Clinton spent the night in Heaven. The next day the paperwork got worked out. On his way up to Heaven, the Pope ran into Clinton. Clinton asked the Pope, "How was your night in Hell?" "Very educational," responded the Pope. "I've learned a lot from the experience, but now I'm glad I'm going to Heaven. I've been waiting all my life to meet the Virgin Mary." "Ooh, sorry," said Clinton, "you should have been there yesterday."

A young boy was told to shoot people with big, bushy, mustaches.
He told by his mother was to shoot them as they were seen as a threat. She gave him a compact pistol to do so. 

The next day, as he was walking along the street, he spotted a man with a big, bushy, mustache. The boy remembered what his mother said yesterday. He approached him, took out his gun, and shot him in the forehead, killing him. The boy, panicked and anxious, ran away to his home as fast as he could, while the victim's skull was bleeding. He had not yet told his mother of what happened as he returned home.

The next day, at early morning, sirens were roaring outside the house. The boy and his mother immediately woke up. Loud knocks were sent through the door. 'Police! This family has 10 seconds to leave the premises right now, or the door will be opened by brute force.' As the policeman started counting down, the young boy reluctantly told his mother of what happened yesterday. 'I shot a man, like you told me to.' His mother feeling both proud and panicked, told him--'Quick! Hide under my skirt, I will talk to the police.' 'I'm coming out!' Said the mother, moving slowly so that her son can move along with her. As she was opening the door, the boy looked up and said -'Mommy! There is a big, bushy, mustache under here too?'. The boy immediately unsheathed his pistol and shot the entire round, killing his mother.

My favorite Clean Joke
A small-town parish priest realizes that he is getting too old to ring the bell in the tower and advertises for a bell ringer. A few days later there's a knock at the door and the priest answers only to discover a  man standing there with no arms. "Can I help you?" the priest asks, to which the man replies that he is there to apply for the job. "I don't want to be insensitive", the priest exclaims, "but I don't see how you can fulfil the requirements of the job?". The man pleads with the priest to give him a chance and the priest decides to acquiesce only to convince him that it's a waste of time. When they get to the top of the tower the priest points to the large bell and says "Well there it is!", but before he can finish the sentence the man starts running straight at it and strikes it face first. The shocked priest shouts "No!! What are you doing?", but again the man runs the length of the bell tower headfirst into the bell, which is starting to sway back and forth. the priest yells "Stop, please, no more" but the guy is already running full speed at the bell and again strikes it headfirst. By now the bell is really rocking back and forth and starting to ring. The priest pleads with the man who is now bruised and bloodied, "For the Love of God, no more", but his pleas fall on deaf ears as the guy sprints across the tower at the swinging bell. Unfortunately, he mistimes it misses the bell entirely and flies off the edge of the bell tower. The priest screams and rushes down the stairs to help the guy. When he gets to the bottom he sees a crowd of people gathered around and pushes his way thru to the bruised and battered body. Someone says "Father do you know this man?", and the priest answers"No, but his face rings a bell!"

Pygmy tribe legend
Once upon a time, there was a magical jungle called Mimbubu.  In this  magical jungle there lived a tribe of Amazon Pygmies.   

 Legend has it that the Mimbubu jungle was inhabited by an evil and  deadly bird, the Foo bird.  The tribe tells the story of how the Foo  bird stalks its prey while passing unaware through the Mimbubu jungle,  and when the unsuspecting victim is least aware, the Foo bird lays a  single bird dropping on them.  Now the bird dropping proves no harm,  but to the unfortunate victim, removing or brushing off the bird dropping  results in instantaneous DEATH!!!  Needless to say, the people of Mimbubu  spend their entire lives covered in bird droppings from the Foo bird. 

 And what, you might ask, is their tribe motto? 

 "If the Foo shits, wear it."

Stupidity is hereditary
A young boy came back from school one evening and complained to his father, "I have a mean teacher who always calls me stupid." The father, angry, replies, "I'll come with you to school tomorrow and confront this arrogant teacher."

The next day, the boy and his father go to school, and the boy shows his father to the mean teacher. The father asks the teacher angrily, "Why do you always call my son stupid?" The teacher replies, "He is indeed stupid, and I'll show you proof that he is." The father replies, "Show me."

The teacher then looks at the student and tells him, "Go to the staff room and look for me and check if I'm there." The student runs off and comes back a while later saying, "I couldn't find you there at all." She then replies, "Ok then, go to the school library and look for me, I might be there." The student runs off and comes back a few minutes later saying, " I looked for you in the library, but I couldn't find you!" 

The teacher then looks at the father in a cocky way as to tell him look at your stupid son. The father looks back at the teacher, frowns, then says, "Just give him a little while longer, I think you might be absent today."

When the drunk begins kicking his arms and legs, the preacher pulls him up. The preacher asked the drunk again, "For the love of God, have you found Jesus?" 

  


The drunk wipes his eyes and catches his breath and says to the preacher, "Are you sure this is where he fell in ?"

"As we contemplate the shared contributions of graphite and rubber in the advancement of literature,
we consider graphite and its role in recording transformative ideas with exquisite prose,
and rubber for eliminating substandard word choices and ideas best left forgotten.
We should remember that they both contribute equally.
For to believe that somehow graphite is more important is just being erasist."

Good ole little Johnny was sitting in class
The teacher drew a line with three birds on it up on the blackboard.



"Ok, class, there are three birds on a wire, if one of the birds falls off, how many birds are left?"



As she erases one of the birds on the blackboard, little Susie in the front row raises her hand and answers, "There are two birds left."

"Very good Susie, that's right, there are two birds left." Susie smiles.



Little Johnny is watching this from the back of the class, clearly bothered. "No, no, no..." he says as he raises his hand.

With sigh of resignation, the teacher asks, "Ok, Johnny, what is it?"

Johnny begins, "Well, for starters, birds don't fall off of wires..."

"Ok..." the teacher starts when Johnny forges ahead.

"If it fell off, then it was probably shot, and if it was shot then the other birds would have flown away."

"So the correct answer is zero birds." he finishes.



The teacher replies, "Well Johnny, that makes a lot of sense, I like the way you think!"



Johnny continues, "Ok, now I've got one for you: there are three women in an ice cream parlor. One is licking the ice cream, one is biting the ice cream, and one has the whole cone shoved in her mouth!"



With a sly look, Johnny asks, "How can you tell which one is married?"



With an even louder sigh than the first, the teacher responds, "I don't know Johnny... the one with the cone shoved in her mouth?"



Johnny smiles and replies, "No. The one with a ring on her finger... but I like the way *you* think!"

Bird and elephant
It's a bird wandering in the forest, and he comes across an elephant. When he sees it, he falls in love right away. He goes up to him and says, "I'm crazy about you! I want to fuck you!". And the elephant says, "Uh, no, thanks." So the bird starts begging him: "I'm begging you! Let me fuck you, let me fuck you!" "Man, even if I let you do it, look at you and look at me, it ain't gonna work." "I don't care, just let me fuck you!" After a while the elephant gets tired of it and says to the bird, "Okay, knock yourself out." So the bird starts fucking him, but of course the elephant doesn't feel anything. And right above them, in a tree, there's a monkey with a coconut watching them. He's thinking, "This is incredible, there's a bird fucking an elephant!" He starts laughing like he's never laughed before and finally drops his coconut, it falls on the elephant's head and he says, "Ouch, that hurts!" And the bird in the back says "Bitch ! You like this huh ?!"

A skilled, anonymous criminal was infamously wanted for multiple cases of robbery and theft.
...and it was rumored that he was planning to steal the riches of the wealthy mayor of the city. Since this criminal was known to have pulled off such fantastic heists before, it was no doubt that he would eventually successfully achieve this goal, which meant that the police station was on high alert for the criminal. The police didn't know who this criminal was, but they had a few clues: he spoke spanish, a language not well known throughout the city, and he also had a knack for disguises and false identities, which meant he could be anyone, and the police has not been stopping to figure out who he is.

"But, fortunately, we managed to get his identity, and we caught the damn bastard last night!" the police interrogator exclaimed in the interrogation room, infront of the criminal. "*Un*fortunately, he's already managed to steal the money, and has hidden it somewhere safe, and I want him to tell me where that is. Except I don't speak spanish, and nor does anyone in this damn building, so that's why we need YOU, the translator," he points to the other man in the room, "to get him to tell us where he hid it. Let's start."

The interrogator spoke first. "Ask him, where does he keep the money?"
The translator asked the criminal, and he spoke back in unfamiliar words. "He says he will not tell," said the translator.
The interrogator said, "Tell him to speak up, or we will put him to death sentence for his crimes."
The translator spoke accordingly, and the criminal seemed so visibly frightened by this, that he immediately told him its location. "By the old graveyard, under the second tree from the entrance! There's the money bags!" he said in Spanish.

Trying to keep a grin, the translator decievingly told the interrogator that "he would rather die, than tell you where he has hidden it." Then the interrogator knew.

Suddenly, both the interrogator and the 'criminal' took a handgun out and pointed it at the translator. The interrogator said, in perfect spanish, "Skilled robber my ass, all it took was a clever lie!"

And if any don't bring it he'll whip their back with his dick.   


So the next day every animal in the woods lines up in front of bear's cave and leaves him a piece of meat, but the rabbit as he is weak and can't hunt he left him a carrot.

The rabbit screamed, cried, squealed... And then started laughing.   


The bear asked "What's so funny?"

A Rabbi and a Priest are talking.
They are arguing about whose religion is better.

Then, the priest goes to the rabbi, ‘Admit it, you’ve tried pork.’ The rabbi tells him that he hasn’t. The priest carries on asking him until eventually the rabbi admits it. He says, ‘Yeah I’ll admit it, I’ve tried it once. But now you admit something. You’ve had sex.’ The priest, much like the rabbi, is adamant that he hasn’t. But the rabbi keeps on pressing him until the priest says, ‘Okay I’ll admit it, I’ve had sex once.’
The rabbi goes, ‘A lot better than pork right.’

A little boy goes to his dad and asks:
'Dad, what's Politics?' 

Dad says, 'Well son, let me try to explain it this way: 

I am the head of the family, so call me The Prime Minister. 

Your mother is the administrator of the money, so we call her the Government. 

We are here to take care of your needs, so we will call you the People. 

The nanny, we will consider her the Working Class. 

And your baby brother, we will call him the Future. 

Now think about that and see if it makes sense.' 

So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. 
Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. 
He finds that the baby has severely soiled his nappy. So the little boy goes to his parent's room
and finds his mother asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and see s his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy say's to his father,

'Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. ' 

The father says, 'Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.' 

The little boy replies, 

'The prime Minister is screwing the Working Class while the Government is sound asleep. The People are being ignored and the Future is in deep shit.'

A rabbi, a Hindu priest, and a politician went hiking.
Night fell and they were exhausted. The hotel on the map was nowhere to be seen.

They knocked on the door of a farm and asked if they could spend the night.

The farmer said, “Of course, but I only have a small room with two beds. One of you will have to sleep in the barn.”

The Hindu priest said, “I need no material comforts. I will gladly take the barn.”

The rabbi and the politician were settling in when they heard a knock on the door. They opened it to find the Hindu priest standing there.

“So sorry, my friends, but there is a cow in the barn, and I cannot sleep beside such a holy animal.”

The rabbi said, “No problem, my brother. I’ll take the barn.

The Hindu priest and the politician were settling in when they heard a knock on the door. They opened it to find the rabbi standing there.

“So sorry, my friends, but there’s a pig in the barn, and I can’t sleep beside such a filthy animal.”

The politician said, “OK, let it be remembered that I sacrificed my comfort for the greater good.”

The rabbi and the Hindu priest were settling in when they heard a knock on the door. They opened it to find the pig and the cow standing there.

A young woman gets her first job at the Tickle-me Elmo factory.
The boss takes her up to the office that overlooks the assembly line and tells her what her job is. Then he sends her down. About an hour later the line leader comes up to the office and says, “Boss you gotta get this new girl off my line. She’s killing production.”
The boss looks down out of his office and sees the girl. The line is backed up terribly. Every time a tickle-me Elmo gets to her she takes a leather pouch and places 2 marbles in it and attempts to sew it between the Elmo’s legs. 
The boss laughs and tells the line leader to bring the girl up. When the girl gets there she starts frantically apologizing and saying she’ll try harder. The boss stops her and says “I think you misunderstood me. I told you when an Elmo gets to you on the line to pick it up and give it 2 test tickles.”

A police officer stopped a car for speeding
A police officer pulls over a speeding car. The officer says, ‘I clocked you at 120 km/h sir.’ 

The driver says, ‘Christ, officer I had it on cruise control at 100, perhaps your radar gun needs calibrating.’ 

Not looking up from her knitting the wife says, ‘Now don’t be silly dear, you know that this car doesn’t have cruise control.’ 

As the officer writes out the ticket, the driver looks over at his wife and growls, ‘Can’t you please keep your mouth shut for once?’ 

The wife smiles demurely and says, ‘You should be thankful your radar detector went off when it did.’ 

As the officer makes out the second ticket for the illegal radar detector unit. The man glowers at his wife and says through clenched teeth, ‘Fk it woman, can’t you keep your mouth shut?’ 

The officer frowns and says, ‘And I notice that you’re not wearing your seat belt sir. That’s an automatic $75 fine.’ 

The driver says, ‘Yeah well, you see officer, I had it on but took it off when you pulled me over so that I could get my license out of my back pocket.’ 

The wife says, ‘Now dear, you know very well that you didn’t have your seat belt on. You never wear your seat belt when you’re driving.’ 

And as the police officer is writing out the third ticket the driver turns to his wife and barks, ‘WHY DON’T YOU shut the fk up? 

The officer looks over at the woman and asks, ‘Does your husband always talk to you this way Ma’am?’ 

The Wife replies, ‘Only when he’s drunk.’

A young teenage girl was making a living as a prostitute
 and for obvious reasons she kept it a secret from her grandma. One day, the police raided a brothel and arrested a group of prostitutes, including the young girl. The prostitutes were instructed to line up in a straight line on the sidewalk. Well, who should be walking in the neighborhood, but little old Grandma. The young girl was frantic.

Sure enough, Grandma noticed her young granddaughter and asked curiously, "What are you lining up for, dear?" Not willing to let grandma in on her little secret, the young girl told her that some people were passing out free oranges and that she was lining up for some.

"Mmm, sounds lovely," said Grandma. "I think I'll have some myself," she continued as she made her way to the back of the line. A police officer made his way down the line, questioning all of the prostitutes. When he got to Grandma, at the end of the line, he was bewildered. "But you're so old... how do you do it?"

Grandma replied, "Oh, it's quite easy, sonny... I just remove my dentures and suck em dry!"

A B-road walks into a Bar, he orders a pint, sits down, and starts reading the newspaper.
5 minutes later an A road walks into a bar, he orders a pint, sits down, and starts reading the newspaper.

The B-road moves to the opposite side of the bar, peeking frightfully over the top of his newspaper at the larger, higher maintenance A-road.

Later, a motorway walks into a bar, he orders two pints, sits down, and starts to read the newspaper.

The B-road and the A-road both cower in the corner of the bar, scared of the motorway, much larger than themselves and of much higher importance.

Then, a single white line walks into the bar.

Everyone instantly goes up to the barman, attempting to pay their tab, looking immensely worried. 
The barman turns to them and says:
"Why are you so scared of him, he's much smaller than you"
The Motorway stuttered and glanced over his shoulder:
"You don't want to get on the wrong side of him, he's....a c-c-c-cyclepath"

A man and his pregnant wife
A man and his wife had been married for some time now. The woman was pregnant and had been for many months. When her water broke they rushed to the hospital. The man said to his wife

“Honey I can’t watch this, you’re in pain and I just can’t see you suffer like this. I need to leave the room, name our child whatever you like.”

The husband leaves the room and not too long after, his wife gives birth to a baby girl. She named the baby “Love.” The man didn’t think much of this other than the fact it was a weird name.

Years had past and the daughter came home from school crying. So her father asked 

“Baby what’s wrong?”

She told her dad that she was getting bullied because of her weird name. Her father told her that it was going to be okay. She went up to her room and kept crying.

A few years later and the same thing happened. The girl, Love, came home from school crying only for her dad to ask why. She said it was from her name.

Years later and Love was in her senior year of high school. She came home one day crying as usual and when her dad asked why, she said it was from her name. She kissed him on the cheek and went upstairs to her room to cry. The man thought this was weird because she hadn’t done this since she was a really little girl. So he talked to his wife about it and they agreed to go upstairs to check on her. They went upstairs and knocked on her door.
There was no reply.
They opened the door and Love wasn’t there. Suddenly, there was a gunshot. The parents were worried their daughter had killed herself. So they turn around and find that she is standing behind them with a gun pointed at her dad. The man looks down at his chest and sees that there is blood coming out. He looks at his wife and says

“Shot through the heart! And you’re to blame, darling you gave love a bad name!”

Possibly the funniest clean joke of all time.
This guy owns a circus, see? And one day he's in there, checking out the big top, and this scrawny little guy walks in the door. He walks over to the boss, and he says "Are you the boss here?"

Guy says "Yeah. What do you want?"

He says "I'd like to join the circus. I got an act."

The guy says "Oh, yeah? Well, let me see what it is."

So this little guy goes over to the center pole, and he starts climbing up the pole. And he goes all the way up. He climbs up and up and up. He goes all the way up to the very peak of the big top.

And he looks down, and he takes a deep breath, and he leaps off, and he starts flapping his arms.

And he starts flying! And he flies all around
the big top! He goes all the way around the place. He goes around the center pole. He goes loop-de-loop through the trapezes. 

Then he gets all the way up, and he takes a nosedive right down to the ground, flapping his arms like mad. And he lands right next to the boss. And he says "Well, what do ya think?"

The boss says "That's all you do? Bird imitations?"

Third time is the charm.
A grocery store opened early for senior citizens. A long, orderly line began to form.

The third time the young man walked up and yelled, "If you old people don't let me unlock the door, none of us are getting in!"

A man enters a barbershop for a shave. While the barber is foaming him up, he mentions the problems he has getting a close shave around the cheeks.
“I have just the thing," says the barber taking a small wooden ball from a nearby drawer. "Just place this between your cheek and gum."

The client places the ball in his mouth and the barber proceeds with the closest shave the man has ever experienced. After a few strokes, the client asks in garbled speech, "And what if I swallow it?"

"No problem," says the barber. "Just bring it back tomorrow like everyone else does."

A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night to meet, and have dinner with her parents
Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time. The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms.

He tells the pharmacist it’s his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex.

At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he’d like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.

That night, the boy shows up at the girl’s parents house and his girlfriend meets him at the door.

“Oh, I’m so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!” she says.

The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl’s parents are already seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.

10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.

Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and Whispers to the boyfriend, “I had no idea you were this religious.”

The boy turns, and whispers back, “I had no idea your father was a Pharmacist.”

So drunk he can't stand up
An Irishman's been drinking at a pub all night. When he stands up to leave, he falls flat on his face. He tries to stand one more time, but to no avail. Again, he falls flat on his face. He figures he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that will sober him up. Once outside, he stands up and, sure enough, he falls flat on his face. The Irishman decides to crawl the four blocks to his home.

When he arrives at the door, he stands up and falls flat on his face. He crawls through the door into his bedroom. When he reaches his bed, he tries one more time to stand up. This time, he manages to pull himself upright but he quickly falls right into bed. He is sound asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow.

He awakens the next morning to his wife standing over him, shouting, "So, you've been out drinking again!"

"Why do you say that?" he asks innocently.

"The pub called. You left your wheelchair there again."

The therapist says, "Okay, first of all, how often do you have sex?" The husband says, "Once a week." The therapist says, "That's not bad at all. When and where do you usually do it?" The wife says, "Every Thursday night, 8:00, doggie style in front of the TV." The therapist says, "Well that might be something we can work with. Have you ever thought of changing it up a little, maybe vary your positions, do it at different times, different places around the house?"  They both say, "*WHAT??* And miss Maverick???"

Crap
A young man went to a house to pick up his blind date. The girl wasn't quite ready, so her father  invited the lad to sit on the couch and wait. Dad sat in his easy chair and proceeded to read his newspaper, while the family dog, Rover, jumped onto the couch and sniffed out the stranger. 

Suddenly, the young man felt the urge to fart and didn't know what to do, however, since the dog was nearby, he decided to squeak it out and feign innocence. 

"Brrroough," went the fart! Dad peered over his newspaper and said, "Rover! Get off that couch!" 

The young man was relieved. Obviously, Dad thought Rover had done the deed. Soon, another fart rumbled in the young man's guts, and he let it rip, assured that Rover would once again be blamed. 

Sure enough, Dad peered over his newspaper and said more sharply, "Rover! I said get off the couch!" 

Happily, the young man decided that he could fart whenever the urge arose and he let yet another one fly. 

Finally, Dad threw down his newspaper in disgust and bellowed, "Rover! FOR GOD'S SAKE, GET OFF THAT COUCH BEFORE HE CRAPS ON YOU!!!"

Two construction workers were eating lunch on a bench on the side of the road...
As they were eating lunch, they notice a very attractive woman walking on the other side of the road. The two workers start to cat call her until she stops and looks at them. 
Once she looks at them, they make the notion for her flash them by pulling up on their shirts. The woman looks around and hesitantly pulls up her shirt and waves at them. 
The two workers are getting all excited and see if they can take it further. They start yelling across the street for her to completely strip for them. Once again, she looks around and hesitantly gets completely naked on the side of the road and blows them a kiss!

At this point, the two workers are jumping up and down and giving each other high fives. All of a sudden, the female looks at them and yells, “Your Turn!”

The two construction workers are getting nervous and one turns to the other and says, “Show her ur nuts, show her ur nuts!!” 

So the worker nods his head and starts flailing his arms and yelling “Lahanalahailaoalhiao”

The Taxi Driver and the Nun
One Halloween night a taxi driver is driving down the street. On a corner he sees a nun. Being a gallant fellow, he pulls up and offers her a ride. The nun graciously accepts and off they go. After a little bit the driver turns to the nun.

"Forgive me sister," he begins, "but it has always been a fantasy of mine to kiss a nun. Would I be able to kiss you?" The nun, obviously startled, thinks for a moment. Finally she turns back to the driver.

"Of course my son." She then points to an empty parking lot. " Pull in here and then you may kiss me." The driver quickly pulls in and deeply kisses the nun. After the event they continue driving. Soon the driver starts crying.

"My son, what is the matter?" asks the nun. 

The man continues to cry and says "Forgive me sister but that was wrong of me. You took a vow of chastity and yet I made you break it to kiss you."

The nun smiles and says "Oh it's quite alright my son. If it's any consolation to you, my name is Dave. I'm on my way to a costume party!"

Two mental patients were walking when they spotted an odd thing on their path and they started arguing about what it was.

Flattered by her request, he thought hard about continuing. He had to work the next day digging holes and couldn't afford to call in sick, though. So sadly he told her he really, really had to stop.

Humans from a parallel universe, where things are vastly different have technologically developed far enough such that the can travel to another universe
They start by finding the human civilisations in other universes. After looking around a while, they found a magical land where if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force.

Fascinated by this and wanting to harness it, the humans sent one of their own to the planet.

Years pass and the human finally comes back. When asked about the mysterious power, he said "Because of inertia". The other humans did not understand what that meant and thought that the speech of the people on that planet had affected him. As such they thought he meant that the mysterious power was only in Ertia which they assumed to be the planet.

Still wanting to harness the power, they unleashed a deadly plague on that planet and wiped them out, and then inhabiting it themselves for generations and generations.

A recently divorced man...
A recently divorced man, feeling a bit down in the dumps, heads to his local bar. After about 15 minutes, a beautiful woman sits down next to him and strikes up a conversation. They’re getting along great, talking away, when the woman confides to him that her husband divorced her because he thought she was too kinky. The man brightens up and says “what a coincidence-my wife divorced ME because she thought I was too kinky”. Well, one thing leads to another and they decide to go to her place. They get there and she tells him “have a seat on the couch and I’ll slip into something more comfortable”. She goes into the bedroom and starts to change and pulls out all the stops: Bullet bra, bustier, high heels, riding crop, etc. As she comes back into the living room she sees the guy heading out the door. She says “hey-where are you going?” The guy says well…..I’ve already fucked your dog and shit in your purse. I’m outta here!!

Now the bartender becomes really skeptical. She says: “I just saw you walk in here, you can’t be blind!”

A classic Canadian Joke.
A Mainlander is driving down the highway and runs over a rabbit. Wondering what noise was, he stops his car and gets out to look. While he's standing there a newfie pulls up and asks him what's going on.

The mainlander says, "I'm just here visiting your fair province and I seem to have killed one of your animals."

The newfie takes a look at the rabbit and says, 
"No problem, by’s. Hang'er down a few."

The newfie then goes to his truck and gets an aerosol spray-can, which he proceeds to empty onto the rabbit. When he's done he chucks the empty and says, "There ya go, me son. Enjoy yer stay" then gets in his truck and takes off.

The rabbit gets up, hops 10 feet towards the woods, turns around and waves, hops another 10 feet, turns around and waves, hops another 10 feet, and finally disappears into the woods.

The Mainlander is blown away. Wondering what the newfie did, he grabs the can out of the ditch and reads the label, which says: "Hair spray. Gauranteed to bring dead hair back to life with a permanent wave"

Area 51 Gaurds V.S. Wife
You’ve all heard of the Air Force’s ultra-high-security, super-secret  base in Nevada, known simply as “Area 51?” Well, late one afternoon, the  Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna  landing at their “secret” base. They immediately impounded the aircraft  and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot’s story was  that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he  was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI  background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the  investigation.  
 By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was  lost and wasn’t a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a  terrifying “you-did-not-see-a-base” briefing, complete with threats of  spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way  on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.  
 The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the  same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP’s surrounded the plane…  only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped  out and said, “Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane  and you have to tell her where I was last night!”

Two blind pilots enter a plane.



They have sunglasses and white sticks. As the
plane starts to move, the passengers are
uncomfortable. The plane gains speed, but it
Stays on the ground. The remaining runway gets
Smaller and smaller, and the plane is rushing
towards a fence.

The passengers start shrieking and suddenly the
plane lifts, avoiding the fence at the last second.
All the passengers calm down, thinking it was a
bad joke.

In the pilot cabin, the co-pilot turns to the pilot
and says : "You know what? One day they're

The man tells the bartender, "I bet you $100 that this is a talking dog."

The bartender says, "Ok, if it is a talking dog, I will give you $100. But if it isn't, then you give me $100 and I'll throw you and the dog out that window."

The man looks to the dog and says, "Ok, boy: what is on top of a house?"

A Russian, an Ameican, and a British admiral...
...were having a drink on an American aircraft carrier. They were talking about the bravery of their sailors.

The Russian said “ I will demonstrate the bravery of our sailors.” He calls a sailor over and says “Jump off the ship. Swim under it and climb back up”. The sailor promptly salutes and jumps off the flight deck, swims under the ship, climbs up the davits and stands in front of the admiral and salutes. The Russian says “ That gentleman is courage"

The American says that's nothing.He calls over a PO and says “ I want you to jump off the bows. Swim under the ship to the stern and then return" The PO salutes jumps of the bow swims to the stern and climbs back up to stand in front of the admiral and salutes. The American says “ That gentleman is courage"

The admiral says “I want you to climb the highest mast on the carrier, jump off, swim under the boat from bow to stern and then from beam to beam then climb up the mast and do it again" The matelot looks at the admiral and says “You can fuck right off" The admiral turns to the other two and says “ And that gentleman is courage"

A shipwreck, only Scarlett Johansson and some random dude survived on an deserted island...
They didnt know each other before the shipwreck, but he did know who she was...

At the beginning it was hard, but as time passed, this guy learnt how to provide food and shelter, he started taking care of her, and eventually she started caring about him... after all, there wasnt anybody else in the island...

He eventually built a cabin, had a functioning automatic potable water supply, and all sorts of little clever commodities, all done to make her life easier... it was the most effort any man had ever done for her, and all the hard work made him fit, she noticed this...

One night after some wildlife attacked and he defended her succesfully, getting a few cuts in the process, she threw herself at him and they made love, after that, they where for all intents and purposes a couple with an above regular sex life.

But for some reason he started drifting away, something was bothering him. And she noticed... "Whats wrong?" Scarlett Johansson asked, "Nothing..." the guy would say...

She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasnt asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...

    "Really?, youll do anything id like?"

    "yes" she said "anything!"

    "ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shore"

    "ok..."

    "now put this shirt on please, but first, "tape" your boobs so they are flat"

    "wha... ok, id say id do anything" she said lovingly.

    "ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under it"

she was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tuck her hair under the hat.

    "Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustache"

    "ok... if this is what you want..." she muttered.

    "now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach ill catch up to you in a bit" he said a bit excited...

She started walking... wondering... doubting herself... just confused about what had just happened, maybe it wasnt her, maybe it was h... suddenly the guy grabs her by her shoulder turns her around and says: "DUDE!!! you wont believe who ive been fucking for the past 6 months!"

The pope's traffic stop
The pope is on tour in the United States. He's sitting in the back of the popemobile, and he says to himself, "You know, this is really getting to be a drag. Every day it's the same crowds, the same homily." Then a light bulb goes on. He says, "Driver, pull over. I'm going to drive for a while. You sit back here. Help yourself to the minibar."

So the pope is doing about 85, and sure enough, the blue lights flash. The state trooper says, "Your Holiness, do you know why I pulled you over?" And the pope says, "Man, I ain't gonna try and bullshit you. I was probably doing a bit over the limit back there."

So the trooper takes the pope's registration back to his cruiser and radios his sergeant. "I got a situation here," he says.

"What, did you pull the mayor over again? I thought I warned you about that," the sergeant says. "No," says the trooper. "It's worse than that."

"Well, what, did you pull the governor over?" says the sergeant. "No," says the trooper. "It's worse than that.

"Holy moley, did you pull the President over?" says the sergeant. "No ... worse than that."

"What could possibly be worse than pulling over the President?" the sergeant demands. And the trooper says, "Well, I don't know. But he's got the pope for his driver."

Jungle Drums


An anthropologist went to study a far-flung tropical island. He found a guide with a canoe to take him upriver to the remote site where he would make his observations. About noon on the second day of travel up the river they began to hear drums. The anthropologist asked his guide, "What are those drums?"

The guide turned to him and said, "Drums okay, but VERY BAD when they stop."

As they traveled the drums grew louder and louder. The anthropologist was nervous, but the guide merely repeated, "Drums okay. Drums not bad. When drums stop, then very bad!"

Then the drums suddenly stopped. Terrified, the anthropologist yelled to the guide: "The drums stopped! What now?"

The guide crouched down, covered his head with his hands and said, "Guitar solo."

A man consults his physician to change into a better brain. The physician lists the brains the hospital offers and their corresponding price:  
"Here is the brain of a person with a bachelor's degree in chemistry; the price is $25,000."  
"Here is the brain of a person with a master's degree in biomedical science; the price is $50,000."  
"Here is the brain of a feminist; the price is $1,000,000."

The man is surprised by how much the brain of a feminist costs, so he asks, "Why does the feminist's brain cost so much, is it because a feminist is a lot smarter than a person with a master's degree in biomedical science?"

The physician answers, "Hell no! Do you know how many feminists do we have to kill to put together a complete brain?"

A doctor tries to get a pro-vaxxer to vaccinate her kid but runs into a surprising problem
A doctor was doing a checkup on a two year old kid who was new to the neighbourhood, and was shocked to find that according to the vaccination records, the kid was not vaccinated. Assuming that the mom was one of those anti-vaxxers, he prepares a number of pro-vaccination pamphlets to prepare to convince her to the benefits of vaccination.

The mom says, "I don't need pro-vaccination pamphlets. I'm 100% pro-vaccination."

Relieved, the doctor said: "Well, then I'll administer the vaccines right away."

However, the mom said: "No need. The kid is already vaccinated."

The doctor said: "No, I assure you that according to official records, your kid is most certainly not vaccinated. Do you have any documents proving the child is vaccinated?"

The mom said: "Yes, the proof is that my child is alive."

The doctor was like: "Pardon me?"

The mom explains: "Vaccines saves lives, and children without vaccines die. It is hard, scientific fact that no child can survive without vaccination, so the fact my child is alive proves he is vaccinated."

The doctor said: "I'm sorry, but you must have heard some misinformation. Vaccines greatly increase a child's survival rate, but child could survive without vaccines. A child being alive is not proof that he or she is vaccinated."

The mom was shocked: "I can't believe they would let an ANTI-VAXXER be a doctor! You're one of those idiots that believe children could survive without vaccines? What do you take me for, an idiot? You are the reason all these children don't get vaccinated. Not only should you lose your license, you should go to jail."

The doctor said: "No, ma'am. I'm very pro-vaccination. I've performed thousands of vaccinations just last year. I'm just sticking to the facts. You need to get your child vaccinated."

The mom screamed: "We have an anti-vax doctor in the house! He's trying to convince me that children can survive without vaccines!!"

The entire hospital went up in arms. What? An anti-vaxxer doctor working in the hospital spreading misinformation?

The entire hospital chanted: "Throw him out! Throw him out!"

After they threw out the doctor and everyone who supported him, the hospital thanked the mother for her service in helping spreading the benefits of vaccination.

"Remember, vaccination saves lives." Said the mother. "But we have much work to do. We must inform everyone that children couldn't survive without vaccines. The problem is much bigger than us."

Pondering about how to spread the message, someone gets an idea.

"Why don't we flood reddit with anti-vax jokes, and label anyone who disagrees with us an an anti-vaxxer?"

"Sounds like a great idea."

And here we are.

Bosnian X-Files
In Sarajevo hospital, at intensive care unit, a patient would die every single Friday at exactly 11 PM, in the very same bed, no matter what their medical condition may have been. 

Doctors became extremely worried because they couldn't determine causes of their deaths.

Time passed on and people continued to die. Every Friday at 11 PM, exactly the same time, always in the same bed... Some doctors started believing something supernatural had been happening. 

They decided to form an expert group to determine what on earth was going on.

So on the next Friday, few minutes before 11 PM, many specialists and medical experts gathered around "the haunted bed". They even called alternative medicine practitioners. *"Who knows, maybe they can help solve the mystery."*

Some of them had crucifixes and Bibles, holy water, some of them brought Kurans, one even brought a garlic. They, of course, had medical textbooks as well.

When clock marked 11th hour, Rasema entered the room. She was the new cleaning lady. She was surprised to see all the people but she went on with her job. She wanted to show how hard working she was! She unplugged one of the life supporting machines to plug in the vacuum cleaner.

Unfortunately, the husband came home early and caught the two of us in bed. The woman was absolutely terrified, and the husband was livid and looked ready to cause harm to the woman.

“What the hell are you doing here!?” he demanded to know.

“Please, the fault is all mine,” I explain, “I was the one that answered her ad in the newspaper.”

A newly deceased Englishman, stands at the pearly gates
St. Peter tells him that he cannot go to heaven right away because he cheated on his income taxes. The only way he might get into heaven would be to sleep with a stupid, ugly woman for the next five years and enjoy it. The Englishman, decides that this is a small price to pay for an eternity in heaven. So off he goes with this woman, pretending to be happy. As he walks along, he sees his friend the Scotsman, up ahead - with an even uglier woman.

When he asks what’s going on, the Scotsman replies “I cheated on my income taxes and scammed the government out of a lot of money.” They both shake their heads in understanding and figure that they might as well hang out together to help pass the time. Now the Englishman, and Scotsman, and their two ugly women are walking along, minding their own business when they see someone who looks like their old friend the Irishman up ahead.

This man is with an absolutely gorgeous blonde supermodel. Stunned, the Englishman, and Scotsman approach the man and discover it is their friend the Irishman. They ask him how it is he’s with this unbelievable goddess, while they’re stuck with these god-awful women.

The Irishman replies “I have no idea, but I’m definitely not complaining. This has been absolutely the best time of my life, and I have five years of the best sex any man could hope for to look forward to. There is only one thing that I can’t seem to understand. Everytime we finish having sex, she rolls over and murmurs to herself “Fucking income tax”

Three kingdoms border a lake in the shape of an obtuse triangle
One kingdom lies on each side of the lake. For decades, the king's had argued over it's true owner, each claiming to be the first kingdom to settle there, and many tales of magical swords and godly favours to claim divine right. Eventually, this storytelling and legal battling came to no conclusion, so the kings decided to go to war.

The first kingdom is very wealthy, and has a grand army of thousands of Knights in shining armour with state of the art squires and weaponry, expertly trained killing machines.

The second kingdom is moderately well off, and has several hundred Knights in standard armour with enough squires to get by, but all willing in heart and mind.

The third kingdom is very poor, and has only one elderly Knight with his great grandson for a squire, in rusty centuries old armour.

On the eve before the battle, each kingdom decides to have a celebration for the great deeds that are about to be done.

The first kingdom has a great banquet that no words can give justice to, a massive, endless hall of food and delight, dancers and jesters and bards as plentiful as the fine wine and boar that accompanies them.

The second kingdom has not nearly as grand an occasion, but makes the most of what they have, making up for the lack of fine food and entertainment with enough ale to knock out an elephant.

The third kingdom has but scraps to make do with. In fact, so little food do they have that there is only enough for the Knight and boy squire alone to have a feast (a feast by their standards, at least). The elderly Knight is too weak and tired to get up, so the squire prepares the meal. He decides to cook a stew, so hangs a pot over a fire with a noose and cooks what they have into a small broth.

Finally, the great day dawns. The kings did not sleep through the night, and sent their generals to ready their armies. The world sat on tenterhooks.

However, fate had taken a strange turn. The armies from the first and second kingdoms had drunk so much in their revels that not one remained conscious, much to the fury of their leaders. And in the third kingdom, the elderly Knight's back had perished due to old age. The kings were left speechless. There was only one option.

The squires must go to war.

So on the battlefield, a hundred thousand squires in tunics too big for them and wooden swords trampled the ground beneath them as they came to the edge. One gigantic behemoth of an army met the other small but willing force at the peak of the lake.

And the squire of the third kingdom faced them all.

The battle began. Heads were clubbed in, backs broken, knees twisted, hair pulled, and slowly the numbers remaining dwindled. As the hours swept by and the body piles grew high, the kings and their people watched in the greatest suspense the lake ever knew.

And as the sun set, and the dust cleared, finally, a single figure stood atop the mountain of bodies beneath him, victorious. The squire of the third kingdom had won.

This goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is greater than the sum of the squires of the other two sides of the triangle.

RETIRED HUSBAND After I retired, my wife insisted that I accompany her on her trips to WalMart. Unfortunately, like most men; I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and get out. Equally unfortunate, my wife is like most women - she loves to browse.
Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter, from the local WalMart:

Dear Mrs. Harris:

Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion, in our store.
We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to, ban both of you from the store.

Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:

1. June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

2. July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.

3. July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.

4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, 'Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away'. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time and costing the company money. We don't have a Code 3.

5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&amp;Ms on layaway.

6. August 14: Moved a, 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.

7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.

8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' EMTs were called.

9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.

10. September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.

11. October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'Mission Impossible' theme.

12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his, 'Madonna Look' using different sizes of funnels.

The tribesmen bring the three of them to their leader. Their leader tells them, "I want each of you to find me ten fruits-- any fruit, as long as it's the same kind. If you can do that, I will set you free. Do you accept?"

Of course, they all do. They set off.

Jack was the first to come back. He had oranges. He showed it to the leader, and the leader nodded.

"Now," the leader said, "I want you to put all of those up your ass-- and if you make a face, any face, we will behead you. If you can do so without making a face, we will let you go."

Jack did so. The first one was okay, he didn't make any face, but when he got to the second one, he winced, and the tribesmen beheaded him.

Jack watched Bill enter the room with the leader from the afterlife. Bill walked in with berries, and the leader told him the same thing. He did so, making it to nine, when suddenly, he burst out laughing. And of course, the tribesmen beheaded him.

In the afterlife, Jack shouted to Bill, who was still laughing, "what the hell, dude? You could've made it! Why'd you start laughing."

And in tears, Bill replied, "I saw Josh walk in with pineapples."

**Excerpts from the diary of a cat:**

Day 983 of my captivity...

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets.

Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.

The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet.

Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a ‘good little hunter’ I am.

There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of ‘allergies.’ I must learn what this means and how to use it to my advantage.

Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow — but at the top of the stairs.

I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded.

The bird has got to be an informant. I observe him communicating with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now...

Three men arive at the gates of heaven
There they meet the gate keeper who informs the that heaven has been getting a little full recently and that he is only alowed to open the gates for people who have died terrible deaths and that he would need to hear their story.

The first man steps forward and says: i came home early from work today and found my wife naked in bed she told me that she was waiting for me to come home but i didnt belive her i checked all the regular spots the closet behind the door but i couldnt find him. so i went out on the balcony to get some fresh air because this had been a stressfull day but as soon as i open the door i saw that motherfucker habging on the outside of the fence so obviusly i started hitting his hands but he wouldnt let go so i went innside and got a hammer i continued to hit him with that and eventualy he let go but he landed in a bush and survived so i went back inn draged the fridge out on the balcony and tiped it over the edge after that i died of a heart attack because of all the stress. 

The gatekeeper agrees that this was a pretty horibke way to die and lets the first man in to heaven then he asks the second man how he died. The second man answers:

So every day i do some workout on my balcony but today i fell over the edge and started falling but i was fortunate enough to grab onto the balcony below mine so naturaly i started climbing up to try not to fall the remaining 17 floors but before i even start to climb a man comes out on the balcony and sees me hanging there he gets realy angry and starts hiting my hands but i managed to hold on then the madman walks inside and gets a hammer when he started  hiting my fingers with that i couldnt hold on anymore so i fell but landed in a bush and survived but the the lunetic went inside and got his fridge witch he dropt on me and i died

The gatekeeper agreed that this was a terrible way to die so he let him in to heaven. He askes the third guy how he died and the third guy answers

 so imagine this: your totaly naked inside a fridge

Safety critical software
I am a software engineer and I work on safety critical software (I design autonomous vehicles). I travel around the world, speaking at various software engineering conferences. I was recently invited to speak at the premier aviation conference in the world on the subject of writing safety critical software.

I need to be engaging, bring in the audience, and make it all feel personal and real. As usual, I started off with a pretty standard presentation, introducing myself, establishing credibility, talking about the subject matter. But about 15 minutes in, I had everyone in the audience stand up, then I outline a new, hypothetical project and tell them they must evaluate it. I gave them the specifications of an aircraft and a deadline at which the project must be completed. I then told them I would ask them a few questions, and if their answer was "no", they could sit down, but if their answer was "yes", they remain standing.

"Would your marketing department would sell this package?" Everybody remained standing.

"Could your team deliver this on time?" About half of the audience sat down.

At this point, I knew I had them. "Would you be willing to put yourself, your friends, and your family on this plane's first flight?" At this point, the audience kind of grins at each other sheepishly, and slowly everyone sits down. But this time, one man remained standing. I saw this as a great opportunity, fully expecting a discussion about software testing, or something like that, so I asked him, "You, sir! Tell me, why is that you alone among all of these people have the courage and confidence to put your loved ones on the line?"

To which he responded, "If my team wrote that software, the plane would never get off the ground!"

I made a terrible mistake this morning.
I got out of bed.

A girl phoned me the other day, "Come on over, there is nobody home"
I went over.....there was nobody home.

Learning from Construction workers *long*
So a boy is home from school one day, and he's driving his mother nuts. Finally she gets fed up and tells him to go across the street where they are doing construction on a house, and not to come home until he learns something.  
A few hours pass, and the boy comes home. The mother asks "Did you learn anything?" And the boy replies "Yes mom, I learned how to install a door!" the mother says "That's great, so tell me how do you install a door?"  
The son takes a deep breath and then blurts out "Well first you need to find the asshole who took the tape measure, and then you need to measure the fucking frame, and then you need to make sure the fat lazy fuck bought the right size door, and the other asshole actually made the frame right. And then chances are the fucking pins wont line up when you put the fucking door in the frame, so you need to hammer that sonnofabitch until the fucking piece of shit slams in. And THAT'S how you install a door"  
Flabbergasted and furious, the mother screams at her son "GO TO YOUR ROOM AND WAIT FOR YOU FATHER TO GET HOME!". The son hangs his head and obeys, going upstairs to wait.  
An hour or so passes and his father comes upstairs. "Son, I heard you learned something today?"  
The son happily nods his head "Yeah dad! I learned how to install a door!"  
The father looked confused. "Well that sounds harmless, maybe your mother is overreacting. Ok son, tell me what you told your mother."  
The son smiled, took a big breath, and exclaimed "Well first you need to find the asshole who took the tape measure, and then you need to measure the fucking frame, and then you need to make sure the fat lazy fuck bought the right size door, and the other asshole actually made the frame right. And then chances are the fucking pins wont line up when you put the fucking door in the frame, so you need to hammer that sonnofabitch until the fucking piece of shit slams in. And THAT'S how you install a door"  
The father's face turned bright red with anger. He pointed out the door and yelled "That's IT! Go outside and bring me a switch!"  
The boy stood defiantly and said "Fuck you dad, that's the Electricians job!"  
\*note. back in the day a switch was a flexible thin stick that assholes beat their kids with.\*

City slicker buys an old farm
There was a gentlemen from the city who decided he wanted to live a simpler life. He buys an old empty farm. Going to the local general store by his new homestead, he asks where he can get some animals. The owner tells him to go to Old Man Murphy’s farm down the road a ways and he will get him all set up with a few animals. Excited the man heads over to the farm. Upon meeting, Old Man Murphy says to the gentleman I can definitely tell you’re a city slicker- Don’t worry, in time you’ll settle in and be just like one of us. The gentleman than asks well, how about that little hen over there. Maybe I can purchase it from you. Surely that would be a great animal to start with. Old Man Murphy says sure, I’ll sell you that one. But, just so you know young hens are actually called pullets. The gentleman sees a donkey off to the side and says well, that looks like a great animal to have at my new farm they are actually called an ass, right? How about I buy him from you. Old Man Murphy says now you’re starting to sound like a farmer. Yes, I’ll sell him to you but, he’s kind of stubborn. Sometimes he just lays down and won’t move. If you scratch on his back a bit he will get right back up and moving. Lastly, the gentleman says well no farm would be complete without a rooster. How about that one right there. Old Man Murphy says sure but, just so you know a rooster is actually called a cock. The gentlemen says oh yeah that makes sense. He thanks Old Man Murphy and starts the walk back to his own farm holding the birds and leading the donkey. About halfway back to his farm the donkey lays down in the middle of the road when suddenly a shiny red sports car pulls up with a beautiful woman driving. A little aggravated that she can’t pass by because of the animal blocking her way. She scoffs at the gentleman. He looks at her and said I’ll get him out of the way in just minute ma’am but, I need a favor to make that happen. She hesitantly says ok. The gentleman says.... will you hold my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?

“Here. This is a navy blue suit. How do you like it?” the saleswoman asked.

“That looks terrible. I do not want that,” the man said, shaking his head. 

“How about this? A nice, grey suit,” the saleswoman questioned. 

“Ew! That is really atrocious!” the man groaned, recoiling in disgust.

The saleswoman, her temper now rising, held up a black tuxedo and asked, “How about this sir?”

The man yelled, “No! That looks so bad!”

Breaker, Breaker
  There was once a family of three ,a Mom named Shirley,  a Dad named Rick, and a little Boy named Spencer. They owned a cat named Sprinkles.  

 It was a usual Tuesday morning, Rick went to work and Shirley was home with Spencer and Sprinkles. Per usual Shirley started her cleaning regiment, and per usual Spencer and Sprinkles were in her way. After countless times of foot prints on her perfectly clean floors, Shirley broke down and sent Spencer and Sprinkles outside to occupy themselves.  


  It was about forty-five minuets later, and Shirley was dusting the blinds. As she's dusting she's sees Spencer and Sprinkles sitting on the curb in front of the house. She thought 'How cute'. As she watched, she saw Spencer throw some M&amp;M's in the air catch them in his mouth, pick up Sprinkles lift Sprinkles tail up, and lick, He then proceeded to scoot one foot down the curb. Shirley couldn't believe what she saw.. She proceeded to watch him do it again; throw the M&amp;M's up,  catch them in his mouth, pick the cat up, lift its tail, lick, and scoot down the curb a foot. 

 Shirley being very appalled ran outside. She asked Spencer with a tone only a confused mother could have " What in the holy hell are you doing?!?!"  
 Spencer replied "Well, Mama Im playing trucker. Poppin Pills, licking pussy, and moving down the road".

So there’s this farm. On this farm, there’s a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends.
So there’s this farm. On this farm, there's a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends.

They do just about everything together. And one day, they're sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer's kid is watching MTV, and they're watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says "you know what? I'm gonna learn how to do that."

So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, "Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar."

Guy on the phone says "no problem. Come on down."

"No, there might be one problem. I'm a horse."

"Naw, it ain't a problem. We'll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise."

So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he's like "LOOK WHAT I CAN DO" and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says "holy shit. That's awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What's like that?" And horse says "Bass. Learn to play bass."

So Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says "Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar."

Guy on the phone says "No problem, miss, come on down."

"Eh, this might be a problem. I'm a cow."

"Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise."

So Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says "Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that."

Horse says "Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here."

So Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says "Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums."

Guy on the phone says "No problem, man. Come on down."

"Eh, maybe a problem. I'm a chicken."

"Naw. Ain't no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums."

So chicken learns the drums, and he's fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer's out. And one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he's like "what the fuck? that sounds amazing." so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says "Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You're gonna be HUGE."

So Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy's deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they're big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there's a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom's real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they're cool as hell. They say "Listen. Go see your mom. We'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us."

Horse says "Thanks, guys. you're the best," and he takes off.

Couple of days later, Horse's mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It's his agent. Cow and Chicken's plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he's lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He's been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he's on that walk, he just can't shake the blue, so he figures to himself "Alright, alright. One drink, just to get over it."

So Horse walks into the local bar. Bartender looks at him and says "Hey. Why the long face?"

Sherlock Holmes and Watson go Camping
They spend the day tracking small animals, fishing, and having a grand time by the shores of a remote lake, before cooking up their dinner and settling into their beds and drifting off to sleep.

Sometime after midnight, Holmes wakes up feeling insightful.
He wakes Watson up.

"Watson... as you look up into the night sky, what do you deduce?"

Watson rubs his bleary eyes, unsure what to make of Sherlocks sudden midnight curiosity. He rolls over and stares up into the sky, which was lit up with a million stars like diamonds on black velvet.

Watson responds. "Well Holmes, as I stare into the cosmos, I can see that we are on a spinning ball in an infathomable expanse of nothing. The vast emptiness of space and scale of the universe leaves me feeling incredibly tiny, and therefore I deduce that our lives are small and insignificant in the greater scheme of things." 

Holmes ponders this deep and insightful response for a moment. Rarely is Watson so articulate with his feelings.

He turns to Watson, and with a sigh, he says.

"Watson you blithering idiot.... Somebody has stolen our tent"

1 Wish Each
A group of three fatties are hangin' out.

The first one Is very assertive.

The second one is ashamed of his weight.

The third is a comedian.

The  group of friends are on their monthly walk together when they stumble on upon a teapot half-buried in the dirt. The assertive one pushes ahead and digs up the teapot and out pops a magical genie. 

"You have one wish each for freeing me from my eternal prison," said the magical genie.

The friend ashamed of his weight was quick to make his wish. "I wish to be slim and fit."

"Your wish has been granted." The magical genie waved his hands and the wish was granted. The guy ashamed of his weight was now slim and fit.

The comedian is dying with laughter.

The  assertive one, bewildered at the comedians amusement went next. "I wish to be slim and fit like that guy." 

"Your wish is granted," again the genie waved his hands and the assertive man was slim and fit.

The comedian is rolling around on the ground face red of laughter. The two others waited impatiently, for the comedian to make his wish, pestering him to hurry up.

The comedian, still wheezing hysterically, said in a high pitched voice, "I wish... I wish that my friends are transformed fatter than they were before they made their wishes!"

Instead of calling them “carriers.”
Instead of calling people who go out in groups or otherwise ignore safe procedures around the coronavirus and then become carriers of the virus shouldn’t be called just “carriers”, I think it would be more effective to get them to think about their actions and how now carrying the virus can spread it to grandma, so instead they should be called “spreaders”, but then people would confuse them with your mom.

Being Muslim is tough
Since i was a young boy my father has imposed his religion onto me. I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Hindus or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.

“Ok, so he was an Emperor because he had an Empire?” Don asks slowly

“Yes”

“Ok, well I don’t have an empire yet...” replies Donald “so how about I am called a King?”

“Well Donald, you don’t have a Kingdom, so I can’t call you a King..”

At this point the Don is getting frustrated. “Queenie, this is ridiculous, if I don’t have an empire, and can’t be an emperor, and I don’t have a kingdom, and can’t be called a king, then what can I be called?”

The Queen pauses for a moment, take a look at Philip and then replies “Well, Donald, you are in charge of a country...”

"If I died and you remarried and she lived in this house," the wife asks, "would she sleep in our bed?"

"Well, the bed is brand-new. It's going to last a long time. I guess she would."

"If I died and you remarried and she lived in this house and slept in our bed, would she use my golf clubs?"

"Oh, no," the husband replies. "She's left-handed."

At the movie theater a man noticed a young woman sitting all by herself. He was excited to see she had both hands under her skirt and was playing with herself furiously.
 
He moved to the next seat to her and offered his help. She agreed, and the man started fingering her like crazy. 

When he became tired and withdrew his hand, he was surprised to see her go back to work on herself with both hands.

"Wasn't I good enough?" he asked sheepishly.

"You were great," she said, "but these crabs are still itching!"

A man contracted a rare STD...
He finally went to the hospital to get his manhood examined. 

He nervously took off his pants, "Doctor, what is wrong with me? It's been getting more and more painful down there." 

After close examination, the doctor said in a grim voice, "I'm afraid we have to perform surgery to have it removed." 

"What? I can't just let it be chopped off like that!" Unsatisfied with the doctor's response, the man left the hospital. 

Later that week, the man decided to go to a traditional doctor who specialized in natural and herbal remedies. Hopefully they had some better solutions. 

The man took off his pants once again. The traditional doctor smiled and said, "Don't worry, you don't need to have it cut off.  Hospitals just want to perform surgery every chance they get. Let me give you a prescription for some herbal medicine." 

The man let out a big sign of relief. The doctor continued, "Apply these herbs to your nether regions 3 times a day for a week. It should fall off on its own."

A little old lady went to buy cat food. She picked up three cans, but was told by the cashier: "I'm sorry, but we can't sell this to you without proof you have a cat. Too many seniors are buying cat food to eat. Management wants proof that you are buying this for your cat."
So the lady went home, brought in her cat and was sold the cat food.

The next day, she comes in and tries to buy two cans of dog food and was again told she couldn't buy them without proof.
So the lady went home, brought in her dog and was sold the dog food...

One day later, she brought in a box with a hole in the lid and asked the cashier to stick her finger in the hole. The cashier said:
"No, you might have a snake in there."

The lady assured her that there was nothing in the box that would harm her. So the cashier put her finger into the box, quickly pulled it out and screamed:
"That smells like shit."

The lady replied:
"It is... I want to buy two rolls of toilet paper please."

Another Golfing Woman Joke
A comely young blonde decided that she wanted to learn how to golf. So she goes to the pro shop at a course near her home, and signs up for lessons.

Well, she's a natural at it, so after a couple of weeks of instruction, the pro suggests she go out and play 9 holes.

Early the next morning, she's ready for a 7:00 tee time. She tees up the ball and drives it 155 yards right down the fairway.

As she's walking to her lie, however, she gets stung by a bee, and her approach shot to the green is affected by the pain.

She shoots one over par on the hole, but before she tees up on the second hole, the pain from the bee sting is too much for her, and she heads back to the clubhouse.

The pro sees her coming, and runs out, wondering what's wrong. She tells him about the bee sting, and he asks where it happened.

"Between the first and second hole" she replied.

The pro nodded sagely and said "I see your problem. Your stance is too wide".

"I'm going for a light lunch," says my coworker as she heads towards the breakroom.

Three nuns passed away and went up to Heaven. They were pleasantly surprised when Saint Peter informed them that in exchange for their many years of servitude and chastity, God Himself was going to bestow upon them each one wish...
The first nun said with a blush, "This is slightly embarrassing, but I have to admit, while I did love serving the Lord, the vow of chastity was really tough on me. May I return to Earth for a weekend of unbridled lust, with the face and body of Angelina Jolie?"

Saint Peter said, "Your wish is granted!"

POOF

She disappeared and returned to Earth to fulfill her fantasy.

The second nun agreed and said, "I'd like the same, but may I return with the face and body of Jessica Alba?"

Saint Peter said again, "Your wish is granted!"

POOF

Away she went!

The third nun, an Italian girl, nodded her head in agreement, "I too would like the same, but may I return with the face and body of Alice Gan Pipalini?"

With a confused look, Saint Peter replied, "I'm sorry Sister, but I do not know of her? Is she a famous starlet?"

The Sister squealed with excitement,"Oh my, yes, yes she is! She's the most famous one of them all! Why, look at this article I've been saving for years!"

And with that, she reached into her pocket and pulled out an old, yellow, folded up newspaper article, which she handed to him with shaking hands.

Saint Peter slowly unfolded the paper and read the headline aloud,"Alaskan Pipeline laid by 500 men in one week."

Early 90's Video gamer
Sonic on mega drive was my first lover....

I would always give it a 'blow' before i started 'playing with it' and only then would i get any pleasure myself. We would go for hours as i knew 'which buttons to press' and i would press them 'in all the right places'. I must admit, it would end up getting really 'hard for me'. The only thing left i needed to do was 'beat it'.

After a while i realised i just couldn't 'finish' and inevitably i ended up 'cheating' to get the job done. It all came to an end when i 'dumped it' for a 'better model', Sonic 2, which would also allow a friend to join in the fun.

A kindergarten teacher was playing a game with her class
The game involved little hard candies, handing one of each flavor to every student. She told her students to eat the red ones first, then guess what it tastes like. They all ate the red one and after a few minutes they guessed it tasted like Strawberries, they were correct. Next the teacher had them eat the orange one with the hint 

"the answer is in the name." 

They ate and guessed it tasted like orange. The green one was tricky, but they were able to guess it was lime. Then the teacher had them eat the clear white ones, these were honey flavored, but the children couldn't tell what it was.

"I'll give you another hint." She told the class. "Sometimes your parents call each other this."

Not a moment later, little Sally had a look of shock and spit hers out in fear.

"Why did you spit yours out Sally?" The teacher asked.

Two friends walk into a bar
The bartender greets them with a smile and a “What’ll it be boys?”
Friend one speaks up “You know what? I’m not sure. Got anything special?”

The bartender smiles and tosses him an apple.

“What the hell is this?” He cries.
“Just trust me,” says the bartender with a wink. 

After a deep sigh and a quick glance to his buddy, he takes a deep bit from the apple. “Oh my god! Its vodka!” The man exclaims. 

The bartender says, ”Now turn it around and bite the other side”

The man excitedly turns the apple and chomps on the other end. “This is amazing! Is that Sprite?”

Friend 2 jumps in, “ No way man, let me try one” Bartender tosses him an apple, the man quickly takes bites from both sides and chews them together “Oh wow, it’s rum and coke!” 

Just then a third man sits down at the bar and watches them quizzically. “Where’d y’all get them apples from?”

Friend 1 speaks up, “Hey man you gotta try this,” he points at the bartender, “this guy has apples in any flavor liquor you want!” 

Bartender nods and says, “ I have any flavor you want, not just liquor. Skittles, oranges, carrot...” he mumbles while rummaging under the counter.

The third man speaks up, “You got one that tastes like pussy?”

All 4 men exchange glances. “Uhhhh...actually yeah I do” says the bartender, who dutifully digs around the shelves, produces an apple and tosses it to the man. 

The man takes a large bite and quickly spits it out, “Oh my god! Thats awful! It tastes like shit!”

Bartender says, “Oh. Turn it around.”

The genie then asks “And what about your third wish?”

The Irish man stops and thinks for a min and finally says “I’ll take another one of these!”

In a small American town, a band of squirrels had become quite a problem.
The Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation. After much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.

At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide.

The Episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning. They sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.

But the Catholic church came up with a more very creative strategy! They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter.

And not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue. They took the first squirrel and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel since

Head Larger Than The Shaft...
Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. 

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. 

When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.

He’s a doctor and every time he finishes work he comes to the bar for a hazelnut daiquiri. One night, the bar is all out of hazelnuts. The bartender rummages through the inventory but is only able to find hickory nuts. He improvises a drink in the nick of time.    
    
The doctor comes in right on time and takes a sip.
“This isn’t a hazelnut daiquiri!” He says.
The bartender responds.
“No. You got me, it’s a hickory daiquiri, Doc!”

My father ladies and gentlemen...
So, when we were younger we used to run a single line off the back of one of the snowmobiles, put a splitter on her with two lengths of ski rope about 25' long, gear up with helmets and suits, and throw two guys on on those flying saucers, (you know, like the ones on National Lampoon's Vacation) and then the sled driver would just “giver” down some snow covered back roads. 

Holding the rope with one hand you could steer the saucer by leaning. Object of the game was to knock the other guy off, preferably when he was on or near what were sometimes 10' embankments of ploughed snow at the side of the road. 

Hell of a lot of harmless fun for the most part, until one day it went bad. 

Paul and I had been bashing the hell out of each other for a while, and no one was coming off. I came at him quickly from my side of the road and made the initial impact with him just seconds before an old Ford Econoline “shagging wagon” with the classic big ole cb antenna on it, came round the bend in front of us. 

Long enough story short, I managed to stay over in our lane behind the sled, but as fate and all the timing that goes with it would have it, the van came even with us just as Paul bounced up the embankment, off a tree, and flipped over, on the wrong side of the road. 

Again, in a horrible twist of fate, he came down near the top of the van’s windshield, and the motion of the impact basically impaled him on the antenna that was jutting up from the top of the van. 

He survived the initial impact but later died in hospital. His blood system was poisoned by some ailment related to the dead insects that had beat him to the antenna. 

Maybe if he had had a flak jacket on he might have made it. 

Be careful out there folks. We all did some pretty risky stuff when we were younger. 

Wear protection.

A dad tells his son that he wants him to marry a girl of his choice.
“No” replies the son.
“The girl is Bill Gates’ daughter” says the dad.
“Ok then” replies the son.
The dad goes to Bill Gates
“Can your daughter marry my son?” asks the dad.
“No” replies Bill Gates.
“But my son is the CEO of World Bank” said the dad.
“Then ok” says Bill Gates
The dad goes to the president of World Bank.
“Appoint my son as the CEO of your company” demands the dad.
“No” replies the president.
“But he is the son-in-law of Bill Gates” says the dad.
“Ok” says the president.

And that is how business is done.

Four Fathers at the Bar
Father A, Father B, Father C and Father D were at the bar, enjoying their drinks and happily conversing about their successes in life.

With a bladder full of liquid, Father D went to the toilet to take a shit. 

As the conversation continued between the others, it diverted towards how successful their children were. 

Father A said “My son is one of the most successful architects in the nation, he’s become so rich that he gifted a special friend an entire mansion”.

Father B said “My son is one of the most successful pilots in the world, he’s so rich that he gifted his best friend a private jet.”

Father C said “My son is one of the most popular YouTubers, he just gifted his friends a fleet of Ferraris”

Father D returned from the toilet, hopefully having washed his hands (please be hygienic in the wake of Covid-19). His friends proceed to ask him about his son’s successes, when he replied...

“My son is a gay stripper”

Gobsmacked, bamboozled and flabbergasted... the other fathers replied by asking if he was ashamed of his son, to which his Father D replied...

“Not at all. Recently, his satisfied clients have gifted him an entire mansion, a private jet and a fleet of Ferraris.”

Two boxers light up a blunt
After a couple hours, both of them are pretty damn high, they start telling each other stories. One of them says, "Oh man, the other day I went on the craziest date with my wife. I got home after practice and told her to get ready. A couple minutes later we head out into that beautiful forest next to our cottage.

While we're strolling through the forest, a lion comes out of the bushes. So I punch him and I kick him and I uppercut him all the way to Mars.

We continue our stroll and it's all lovey dovey and we're having a splendid time. All of a sudden a tiger comes out of the bushes. So I punch him and I kick him and I uppercut him all the way to Jupiter.

We continue our stroll and it's all lovey dovey and we're having a splendid time. All of a sudden a dinosaur..." 

His friend interrupts him, "Do I seem that stupid mate? Do you think I'm an idiot? What kind of woman gets ready in a couple minutes?"

Donald Trump met with the Queen of England, and politely asked her, "Your Majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? Are there any tips you can give me?"

"Well," replied the Queen, "the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people."

Trump frowned, and then asked, "But how do I know the people around you are really intelligent?"

The Queen took a sip of tea. "Oh, that's easy; you just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle."

The Queen pushed a button on her intercom. "Please send Boris Johnson in here, would you?"

The Prime Minster walked into the room and said, "Yes, Your Majesty?"

The Queen smiled and said, "Answer me this, if you would, Boris. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?"

Without pausing for a moment, he answered, "That would be me."

"Yes! Very good," said the Queen.

Trump went back home to ask Mike Pence the same question. “ Mike, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?"

"I'm not sure," said Pence. "Let me get back to you on that one." He went to his advisers and asked everyone, but none could give him an answer.

Finally, Pence ran in to his friend Jack Murphy in a restaurant the next night. Pence asked, "Jack, can you answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?"

Jack Murphy answered right back, "That's easy, it's me!"

Pence smiled, and said, "Thanks!"

Pence then went back to speak with Trump. "Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle: It's my friend Jack Murphy!"

Trump got up, stomped over to Pence, and angrily yelled, "No, you idiot! It's Boris Johnson!"

A 12 year old girl was watching tv home alone late at night when suddenly the phone rang
She picked up the phone and a deep voice said 'I am the man with the bleeding finger and I'm two blocks away from you'. Thinking it was a prank she hung up the phone and went back to watching tv. A few minutes later the phone rang again, she answered and she could hear the same deep voice again saying 'I am the man with the bleeding finger and I'm one block away from you'. She started feeling a bit scared but she shaked it off and went back to watching tv. A few minutes later the phone rang again and she could hear the deep voice again saying 'I am the man with the bleeding finger and I am in your street'. She got really scared and went to hide. But suddenly the bell rang and she slowly made her way to the frontdoor. As she opened it she saw a tall man and he said with a deep voice 'I am the man with the bleeding finger and i have a question for you, got a bandaid?'

panda
So this panda is tired of hanging around the zoo and decides one night, when his cage is accidently left open, that he's going to do what people do.

Being after dark, he's heads to the bar for some good 'ol fashion binge drinkin'

So this panda bear is sitting at the bar drinking some beers and is approached by a fine lady who asks him if he wants to go home with her.

So the panda bear obliges and goes back to this gal's place for a night of wild sex.

In the morning he gets up to leave to get back to the zoo, and she says

"You can't leave you have to pay me"

Panda bear says "why would I pay you"

Girl says "I'm a prostitute"

Panda bear says "yeah and I'm a Panda bear"

Girl says "you don't understand".....grabbing a dictionary, she shows the Panda the definition of prostitute: Person who has sex in exchange for money

Quickly thinking, the Panda Bear opens the dictionary to Panda and says "see, Panda Bear : Animal that eats bush and leaves"

Three vampire brothers decide to hold a competition to see which one of them is the most powerful
 

The first brother is the strongest.

"Watch this," he says, and takes off at nearly 100 miles per hour. Two minutes later, he returns, his mouth covered in blood.

"What happened?!" his brothers exclaimed.

"You see that mansion over there?"

"Yeah?"

"Well, I went over there and sucked each and every last family member dry. They are all dead."

"Wow!" his brothers say. "As expected, for you are the strongest."

The second brother to go is the oldest.

"Watch and learn, boys," he says, and takes off even quicker, at 150 miles per hour.

Five minutes later, he returns, both his mouth and his neck covered in blood.

"What happened?!" His brothers exclaimed.

"You see that village over there?"

"Yeah?" They said.

"Well I went over there and killed every last person in the entire village. There is not one left alive."

"Wow!" his brothers say in awe. "As expected, for you are the oldest and have the most experience."

The third brother is the fastest. Not to be outdone, he says "Watch this, and don't blink or you might miss it."

He flies off, faster than the rest of them, going at *least* 200mph.

In only ten seconds, he returns. His entire mouth, nose, and neck are covered in so much blood, it stains the front of his shirt.

"What happened?!" his brothers exclaimed.

"You see that giant tree over there?"

"...Yeah?"

"Well I sure fuckin' didn't."

Quarantine Problem
During this whole quarantine situation, I have been very bored. So to pass the time I have been eating a lot of food. Naturally the more food I've eaten the more times I've had to use the restroom. So as a result I've been using toilet paper at a more frequent rate. 

Here's the problem: I have eaten all my food in my house, as well as gone through all my toilet paper. And unfortunately, I can't go out and buy these supplies due to being in quarantine.

Fortunately, when sitting on the toilet relieving my bowels, I found the perfect solution for both problems. I took my bare hand and wiped the lingering fieces from my crack, and waa laa I found myself a snack.

Dinner is still floating around.

After he puts the dog food at the cash register the cashier replies: "Sorry, you must prove that you have a dog to purchase that. It's a new rule". Angry, the guy leaves. 

The next day he comes to the supermarket to buy cat food. At the cash register, the cashier replies: "You can't buy that without proving that you have a cat". Furious, the guy exits the market.

The following day he approaches the same cashier and gives him a box with a hole in it. "Stick your finger there please" asks the guy. Suspcious, the cashier puts his finger in the box and quickly removes it. 

"Now, smell it"

"This smells like shit, is this a joke ?"

"No, I just needed to buy some toilet paper"

My dad asked me if I was even listening to what he was saying.
That's one weird way to start a conversation.

A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, "I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week?" No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot…
Finally, one man says, "Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m."

He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.

The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.

They roll their eyes, but say, "Okay."

She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.

She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.

They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.

She smiles, and says, "I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45."

The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.

Only this time, she plays left-handed.

The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.

They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out.

She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.

They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.

This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.

They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, "How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?"

The lady blushes, and grins. "When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous." she replies. "I like to switch back and forth."

"When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed."

The guys think this is hysterical.

Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, "What if it's pointing straight up?"

She says, "Then, I'm fifteen minutes late."

Realizing he's extremely late the husband runs home, pours the snails over the path leading to his house, then he rings the bell. His furious wife opens the door.

and clears his voice to the crowd of drinkers. He says, “I hear you Irish are a bunch of hard drinkers.

I’ll give $500 American dollars to anybody in here who can drink 10 pints of Guinness back-to-back.”

The room is quiet and no one takes up the Texan’s offer. One man even leaves.

Ten minutes later the same gentleman who left shows back up and taps the Texan on the shoulder.

“Is your bet still good?”, asks the Irishman.

The Texan says yes and asks the bartender to line up 10 pints of Guinness.

Immediately the Irishman tears into all 10 of the pint glasses drinking them all back-to-back.

The other pub patrons cheer as the Texan sits in amazement.

The Texan gives the Irishman the $500 and says, “If ya don’t mind me askin’, where did you go for that 10 minutes you were gone?”

The Irishman replies, “Oh…I had to go to the pub down the street to see if I could do it first”.

They kept on bidding...
In early 2009, a laboratory decided to do a free giveaway of a virus plushie to the kids in the surrounding region. The plushie had several taped messages inside, telling children how to wash their hands properly and practice proper hygienic standards set bt the WHO.

The parents of the kids were overjoyed to know this, and within days, the plush toy had already sold out.

The laboratory took this as a success and was took over by more requests. They transitioned into a toy company as a result.

In December 2019, one of the plush toys went on auction in Wuhan, China. The proceeds would be donated to an American charity.

The auctioneer spoke. "Alright, our starting price is $100. Anyone have $110? $115?"

One spoke up. "$120!" 

"$120, any more? Going once!"

"$150!", a second one popped. A third one came in as quickly as the second, bidding $160. Then a fourth, a fifth...

...

"$2000!" "$2010!", the eighteenth bidder stated.

"It's going good. Anybody else bidding?"

A woman spoke. "$2020!" Another voice popped up beside the person who had said it. It was her father. "Yeah, same."

"Nice. Nobody? Going once, going twice. And... sold for $2020!"

The auction went quite well, and the plush toy went into the hands of the woman and their father.

They were quite hungry afterwards, so they went to the seafood market nearby and bought a bunch of fish.

However, the dather felt sick, and they decided to go back to their hotel room while the woman bought some food for them both.

Over the next few days, the father's condition worsened. Their breathing got worse, they suffered a fever, and it was decided to bring them to the hospital.

After a few days, it was found that he had a new disease, which looked oddly similar to the plushie his daughter had bid for in the auction. 

This new disease rapidly spread around the world throughout 2020, becoming a pandemic. After becoming the subject of humiliation, the death of his daughter due to the illness, and various death threats, the father realized the laboratory's possible relation to the disease. He analyzed the plushie, and sure enough, traces of the virus causing the disease were on it. He looked up the company and threatened to sue it. 

The story became embedded in myth, and, centuries later, is still the leading myth on how the Virus of 2020 spread across the world.

The man became known not by his name, but by the disease, and the worst mistake he would ever make...

He got Co-bid 19.

Soviet joke: A distraught woman shows up at the Doctor's office. "Doctor, I can't take it anymore! There must be something we can do!"
Her husband wets the bed nightly (no diapers at the time). Apparently, they have tried all of the possible medications and methods. 

"Well, there is one other thing you can do..." says the doctor. "You can attach a hose to his penis and dangle the other end out the window." The wife goes home hopeful and excited.

Several days later, the husband comes in. His face is covered in tears and he's barely holding himself together. 

"Well, how's it going?!" asks the doctor hopefully.

"Doctor, you're a murderer!" exclaims the husband. "My wife was looking for the tip at night and fell from the 5th floor window!"

The New Gynecologist
One morning, it's time for Karen's yearly checkup on her "lady parts." She drives to the Gynecologist, is shown into an examination room, and prepares for the exam. To her mild upset, her usual Doctor isn't there.

"What happened to Dr. Michaels?"

"I'm sorry to tell you this, Mrs. Lewis, but he retired a couple months ago. I'm Dr. Carradine, and I'll be performing your examination today." The new Dr. gives her a reassuring smile, and she's still uncomfortable but tries to go with it. Dr. Michaels had been getting on in years, after all.

But then it was Dr. Carradine's turn to look uncomfortable as he began the examination. Mrs. Lewis couldn't figure out why that was, but the new Doctor looked visibly upset the entire time.

Finally, she had to know: "Doctor, is there something wrong?"

"Well... no. No, everything's fine..."

As the exam went on, though, the new, young Doctor just didn't lose that look of being perturbed by something going on down there.

"Look, tell me what's going on! Right now!" Karen blurted.

The new Doctor sighed, shook his head, and said, "Well, I... I don't really know how to tell you this. There's nothing *wrong,* exactly, but..."

"But what!"

"Well, it's just that you've got the biggest vagina I've ever seen..."

Well, that was it. Karen was seething. She told Dr. Carradine that the examination was *Over*, got her clothing situated, and stormed out of the office. On her way home, though, she started to calm down and think about it. The doctor hadn't been trying to *insult* her... in fact, he'd gone out of his way to keep his mouth shut about what he was seeing until she blustered him into telling her. She decides she'd better have a look for herself.

She gets home, goes into the bedroom, then lays the full length mirror in the corner on the floor. She undresses and puts one foot on either side of the mirror, then looks down.

Just then, her husband leans around the door frame. "Hi, honey, whatcha doin'?" he asks, curious.

Blushing from her neck all the way up into her hairline, Karen stammers, "I, uhhh, I'm just, um... exercising!"

"Okay," her husband shrugs. "Just be careful you don't fall into that big fuckin' hole in the floor."

$500!!!
A guy and his girlfriend are in the shower together when the doorbell rings. The girl is just hopping out so she says, "I'll get it"         She goes to the door with just a towel around her.

There's a guy at the front door who looks at the half-naked beauty and says, "My name is Barry,I'll give you $500 to drop the towel"

The girl thinks for a moment and decides, "What the heck". So she drops the towel. The guy gives her the $500 and leaves.

She goes back upstairs where her boyfriend is just getting out of the shower. He asks, "who was at the door?" She says, "Oh, some guy named Barry"

Boyfriend says, "Oh, that's my mate Barry, did he give you the $500 he owes me?"

An ostrich, a loin, and a giraffe...

Later in the evening, the giraffe is starting to feel the effects of his good times and decides to lay down for a quick nap. Meanwhile, the ostrich loudly asks the waitress to bring them another round before they head out.

As the waitress brings the their drinks she sees something laying on the floor. Without thinking she asks, "Whats that lyin' there?"

The ostrich stifles a chortle and before he can stop himself belts out:

"THAT'S NOT A LION, THAT'S A GIRAFFE"

Smith was a man of cold facts, a scientist, a computer jock, and a confirmed atheist.
He became somewhat obsessed with the desire to prove the truth as he saw it. So he mortgaged his house and sold his car in order to put a down payment on the most powerful computer commercially available. Then Smith plugged it into every data bank in the world, accessed every library in the United States and Europe, and had the machine scan every book published since the invention of the printing press. Finally Smith sat down at the console, took a deep breath, and typed, "Is there a God?"

The monitor flickered, the hard drives clicked, and up on the screen came the words, "There is now!"

Variation of old jokes with music
A school orchestra was on the way to a large concert. The bus was flooded with the excited students. It was so crowded in fact, that the conductor could barely keep track of them all. 

After the concert, at which they played Symphony No. 3, Op. 44, by Rachmaninoff, they were starting to head back to the school. A tuba player thought it would be funny to hide with the instruments under the bus. The conductor, pre occupied with the many students, didn't keep track of that one player.

 Back at the school, one of the other Tubists, who was in on the gag, jokingly said "We must have left him at the concert hall." The conductor, only now realizing that the kid was missing, told everyone to unload the bus, and he would go get the kid. 

Once the conductor was already leaving to get the kid, there was a scream. A girl had started to unload her instrument when they saw the Tubists, dead and crushed.

So a gorilla dies of old age at a zoo...
...right before the zoo opens.  It is the only gorilla at the zoo since they are not very profitable.  However, the gorilla is their most popular attraction by far, and they cannot afford to go a day without it.  So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.

Quickly, the new "gorilla" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo.  People from all over are coming to see the "Human-like" gorilla.  About a month in, the craze has started to wear off.  So, to get peoples attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him.  A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror.  Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lions den.  The man starts screaming "HELP!! HELP!!!"  Suddenly a lion pounces him from behind and whispers in his ear, "Shut the fuck up right now or you're going to get us both fired."

A man with a gold claim in Alaska was cursed.
At first the curse just brought him bad luck, causing vital equipment to break and provoking frequent but small injuries to him and his crew. Soon, however, the curse darkened and diggers the man had hired to help work his claim began to die in bizarre ways. 

One was killed by an African scorpion that should never have made it to Alaska, let alone have survived the cold. A second drank a gallon of the mercury used to separate the gold from the ore.  A third was found with a tree growing up through his body.

The man himself who owned the claim became more and more pale. His eyes became all white. His skin began to give off an overpowering smell of sulfur. He slept all day and at night he wandered the mountain above his claim, coming back each day looking more like a beast than a man.

The curse became so bad the last worker alive ran away to the nearest town to tell the authorities what was happening at the claim. 

In an attempt to save the claim owner's life and lift the curse, a priest was brought in by dogsled to perform an exorcism on the man.

A sherriff from the town came with the priest as a bodyguard. 

The exorcism was long, but apparently successful. Immediately the man's color returned, the sulfur smell disappeared, and he was able to sleep through the night for the first time in six months.

After the man awoke, the sherriff immediately arrested the man and brought him back to town with the priest. Standing in front of the judge, the sherriff was asked what charge the law had against the claim owner whose life had just been so dramatically turned around. 

The sherriff looked at the man, then looked back at the judge and said in a slow and rumbling voice, "Possession as a miner."

A new Chief takes over the Indian tribe..
It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets.

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, "Is the coming winter going to be cold?"

"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold
indeed," the meteorologist at the weather service
responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service
again. "Is it going to be a very cold winter?"

"Yes," the man at National Weather Service again replied, "it's definitely going to be a very cold winter." The
Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. "Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?"

"Absolutely," the man replied. "It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever."

"How can you be so sure?" the Chief asked.

The weatherman replied, "The Indians are collecting wood like crazy."

My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes.
 He was a poultry farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. My grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.

After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken activities. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.

When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.

Why am I telling you all of this backstory? Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.

9 Inch Pianist
A man walks into a bar with a bag. He pulls out a small piano, bench, and a tiny piano player, who begins to play songs on the miniature piano.

The Bartender, intrigued, asks the man where he got it. The man proceeds to show the bartender an old genie bottle. He rubs it, and out pops an old, dusty genie. The man tells the bartender to make a wish.

The Bartender wishes for 1 million bucks. Lo and Behold, rows of ducks begin walking into the bar and filling the entire area. Frustrated the bartender yells to the man "I wished for a million BUCKS!"

To this the man replied, "Did you think I wanted a 9-inch Pianist?"

An overweight businessman decided it was time to shed some excess weight. He took his new diet seriously, even changing his driving route to avoid his favourite bakery.
One morning, however, he arrived at work carrying a gigantic muffin. The office all scolded him, but his smile remained cherubic.

“This is a very special muffin,” he explained. “I accidentally drove by the bakery this morning and there in the window were a host of goodies. I felt this was no accident, so I prayed, `Lord, if you want me to have one of those delicious muffins, let me have a parking place directly in front of the bakery’.

“And sure enough,” he continued. “The fifteenth time around the block, and there it was!”

As the entire plane hears it, they burst out in laughter and the stewardess runs up to the front of the plane to tell the captain that the mic is still on.

A hunter shot a deer which ran into someone else's farmyard.
The hunter went to retrieve his deer but the farmer said it was his because it was on his property. They argued about it. The farmer finally says: “You’re obviously a city feller, but this isn’t the city. Let’s settle this farm style. We’ll take turns kicking each other in the balls until one of us gives up.” The hunter sees that this is the only way to get his deer, so agrees. The farmer says: “OK, I go first.” He kicks the hunter solidly in the balls. The hunter rolls in agony on the dirt for about 6 minutes and is finally able to struggle to his feet. He says: “Looks like it’s my turn.” The farmer says: “You can take the deer.”

Claude the Hypnotist
It was entertainment night at the Senior Citizens' Home.




After the community sing-along led by Alice at the piano, it was time for
the star of the show - Claude the Hypnotist!




Claude explained that he was going to put the whole audience into a trance.
"Yes, each and every one of you and all at the same time," said Claude.




The excited chatter dropped to silence as Claude carefully withdrew, from
his waistcoat pocket, a beautiful antique gold pocket watch and chain.




"I want you to keep your eyes on this watch" said Claude, holding the watch
high for all to see.  "It's a very special and valuable watch that has been
in my family for six generations," said Claude.




He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting,
"Watch the watch --- watch the watch ---- watch the watch"




The audience became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth.




The lights were twinkling as they were reflected from its gleaming
surfaces.  A hundred and fifty pairs of eyes followed the movements of the
gently swaying watch.




They were all hypnotized.




And then, suddenly, the chain broke!!!




The beautiful watch fell to the stage and burst into a hundred pieces on
impact.




"SHIT," shouted Claude.




It took them three days to completely clean up the Senior Citizens' Home and
Claude was never invited back again.

A guy and his pals are going out for some beers
Halfway through their night out, the guy meets a beautiful woman. They chat for a bit and eventually she decides she wants to take him home. The guy hesitates for a second, but eventually agrees.

At her place, they have some more alcohol and they start making out. The girl reaches for his belt and tries to unbuckle it, saying: "I don't usually do this on a first date, but I'm willing to make an exception for you"

The guy gets really nervous, stands up, buckles his belt up again, scribbles a note of his phone number and says he has to go meet up with his friends again.

Confused, the next day the woman decides to text him. "Heyy, I really liked having you around yesterday. How about another date tonight?"

The guy agrees. This time, they get in her bed and watch Netflix together. Again, whilst making out, the woman tries to unbuckle his belt, the guy makes up an excuse and leaves again.

And so it goes on. After their seventh date, the woman desperately texts him, asking why he won't have sex with her.
The guy finally confesses the problem. He tells her that he thinks he has a micropenis. She tells him she's been with guys with micropenises before, and that it's okay.

The next time they meet up, the guy finally built up enough courage to get his dick out. The woman looks at it, thinking it's not that bad at all. She looks him in the eye and says:
"I can't believe you've been this embarrassed about such a small thing all this time!"

So the man glances over at the menu and asks, "Could I have a nice juicy T-bone steak, with chips, peas and a fried egg?"
"Certainly Sir," replies the barman, "but that comes to real money."
"How much money?" inquires the man.
"4 cents," the bartender replied. "Four Cents?", exclaimed the man.
"Where's the guy who owns this place?" The bartender replied, "Upstairs, with
my wife." The man says,
"What's he doing upstairs with your wife?" The bartender replied,
"The same thing I'm doing to his business."

 He took his new diet seriously, even changing his driving route to avoid his favourite bakery.

One morning, however, he arrived at work carrying a gigantic muffin. The office all scolded him, but his smile remained cherubic.

“This is a very special muffin,” he explained. “I accidentally drove by the bakery this morning and there in the window were a host of goodies. I felt this was no accident, so I prayed, `Lord, if you want me to have one of those delicious muffins, let me have a parking place directly in front of the bakery’.

How my Husband and I Terrified a Taxi Driver
My husband and I were dressed and ready to go out for a lovely evening of dinner and theatre.

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

"Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again."

The silence in the taxi was deafening.....

A husband and a wife go to marriage Counseling. [Long]
A husband and wife visit a marriage counselor. First, the wife speaks to the counselor alone.

The counselor asks her, “You say you’ve been married 20 years. So what seems to be the problem?”

“The wife replies, “It’s my husband. He’s driving me crazy! I’m going to leave him if he continues!”
“How does he drive you crazy?”
“For 20 years,” she says, “he’s been doing these stupid things.

First, whenever we go out, he’s always looking at the floor and refuses to go near anyone. It’s very embarrassing.”
The marriage counselor is amused, “Anything else?”
“He keeps picking his nose all the time! Even in public!”
“Hmm, anything else?”
The wife hesitates, “Whenever we’re making love, he NEVER lets me be on top! Once in a while, I’d like to be in control!”
“Ah,” says the counselor, “I think I’ll talk to your husband now.”

So the wife goes out of the room and the husband says to the counselor, “For years I’ve been loving and considerate and I’ve always given her what she wants! What could be the problem?”
The counselor explains, “She says you’ve got these habits that are driving her crazy. First, you’re always acting strange in public—looking at the floor and never going near anyone else.”
The husband looks concerned, “Oh, you don’t understand! It’s one of the few things my father told me to do on his deathbed and I swore I’d obey everything he said.”

“What did he say?”
“He said that I should never step on anyone’s toes!”
The counselor looks amused, “Actually, that means that you should not do anything that would cause anyone else to get angry.”
The husband looks sheepish, “Oh. Okay.”

The counselor continues, “And you keep picking your nose in public.”
“Well, it’s another thing my father specifically commanded me to do! He told me to always keep my nose clean.”
The counselor smiles. “That just means you should stay out of trouble.
And,” he continued, “finally, she says that you never allow her to be on top during your lovemaking.”

“This,” says the husband, “is the last thing my father commanded me to do on his deathbed, and it’s the most important thing.”
“What did he say?”
The husband replies, “With his dying breath, he said, ‘Don’t screw up.’”

The artist says, "You know, this is really going to take a long time. There's so much fine detail." The guy said, "Yeah, I was hoping for super fine detailed work. That's why I chose you to do it."

The artist finally agrees and starts work. He asks the guy, "You know... I just hafta know why you're doing this. I'll tell you what, I'll give you a 10% discount if you just tell me why."

The guy thinks about it quickly and agrees. "Really, there are three reasons:

1) I like to watch my money grow.

2) I like to play with my money.

and

3) If my wife is going to blow a 100 bucks, I want her to do it at home."

Mr. Mann’s choice
A mining company owner and CEO, Mr. Mann, was always focused on profit and straight up bussiness. His only wish now was to have somebody to share his wealth with so he decided to find himself a woman who will like him for who he is.

He met a Russian doctor named Nadezhda. She’s his age (51), witty, sharp-minded and was beautiful (she’s Russian after all). A stereotypical representation of an action movie antagonist but with a kind heart, she would make a great bussiness companion who will genuinely love him for who he is. “I would be happy with her for the rest of my life. Nobody makes a better companion in terms of bussiness and finances than your wife. She’s not in for the money because she has plenty already.”

Weeks have passed and he met a young starlete from Belgium named Chloe. She sure had all the right atributes to double his heart rate in a matter of seconds. Even though she seemed dumb and stupid, he knew that she was in for the money and that once he dies she will inherit everything he owns since he had no sons. “What the heck, why don’t I choose her? An obvious gold digger,  but why do I care? I have no children and I want some fun before I get too old. I don’t need bussiness companions, I need fun!”

A month later he met Margharet, an Australian hardworking housewife. She was born in the wild Australian outback and learned to fight with wild animals at a young age. “A heck of a housewife! I pay my housekeepers and maids 10.000£ a day in total and I can’t fuck them. Not only will I save money, but I also get to fuck her! Money means nothing to her, she only likes me because I go hunting and trekking often. If I get too old and boring will she leave me?”

So, who did Mr. Mann choose?

The one with the biggest tits, obviously!

I know that self employed people and those without health care are having a pretty tough time right now...

An American missionary travels to remote Amazonv village to spread the gospel.  First, thing he realizes is that he needs to teach the natives English; as that's the only language he knows and has Bibles to distirbute.    He ponders and finally approaches the headman of the village.

As the walk along in the forest the missionary see's a bird and points as says "Bird", the villager looks and says "Bird".   The missionary looks upwards and says praise the Lord this might work.  They walk a little further, the missionary passes a tree and points and says "Tree", the villager looks and says "Tree".  The missionary looks upwards again and says praise the Lord this might work.  

They continue with this and it seems to be working.  Finally as they pass some bushes they see a couple having sex.  The missionary thinks to himself; I don't want to teach them any "bad" words so he points at the couple and says "Riding a bicycle".   In the blink of an eye, the villager pulls the bow off his back, notches an arrow, and shoots the man from the couple in the back.

Then the the village points at the couple and says "Riding my bicycle".

Town and Country
A very rich man from a big town goes to the countryside to enjoy fresh air while driving the Ferrari he's just bought. 

He is driving his Ferrari when he spots a peasant sitting by the side of the road, eating some corn and doing nothing else, and decides to prank him. 

He stops the Ferrari, rolls down the windows and asks: - Is it far from here where I'm going to?"

The peasant  thinks for about thirty seconds and answers: - If you are going to hell, it is just a mile ahead. If you are going to buy food, the manure factory is two miles back on this road, but if you are going to get yourself fucked, just let your pants down, it's right here!

A man wins the lottery...
[*I heard this joke for the first time as a 13 year old at a family party. So imagine my mild mannered German 70 year old great uncle calmly telling this joke to the whole table. I had never heard him tell a joke before. It's still one of my favourite jokes*]

A man wins the lottery after years of crippling debt and financial stress.

His first idea is to quit his horrible job. Upon arrival at work and before he can say anything, he is summoned to the office of his boss.

"I'm sorry, but we have to let you go due to changed priorities. As this is not your fault, you will be compensated with a severance pay of $50,000. I'll be happy to introduce you to any future employer. Again, I'm very sorry."

Astonished and surprised, the man leaves his former work place and thinks about his next plans.

He decides to buy his dream car. 

At the car dealership, he is greeted by confetti, flowers and large banderole reading "Congratulations, customer #100,000!"

As the prize is a fancy sports car, he enthusiastically speeds home to finally tell his wife.

Stepping into his home, he slowly tip-toes from room to room to be able to surprise her.
After nearly checking the whole house, it almost seems like his wife is not at home, even though the door was not locked.

Suddenly he sees that the ladder to the attic is lowered. Slowly ascending, he is overcome by a strong suspicion and starts to breathe heavily.

And yes: there she is, dangling from a rope, a chair toppled over, a suicide note on the neatly placed shoes on the floor.

The man stands silent for a minute and finally speaks to himself.

"Well look at that! Seems like I'm on a roll today!"

Wife : "And how much for the ones like mine?"

Husband : "That's where they held the auction."

There were 7 kings. One named after each day of the week.
One of the weekend’s rulers was known for ruling over his military with an iron fist, Such that as little as a cross word said about the state would mean life in prison. 

One example that stands out was that of Sir John. A strong and noble knight who had a short temper when it came to his family name. He spent his days upholding the rules laid out for him and drinking inordinate amounts of ale.

Two peasants ran up to an intoxicated Sir John and blurted “your mom’s a rocket, man!”

Three seconds later, the usually steel faced knight slapped the bums across their faces. It took no longer than a few minutes for the king himself to show up with a sickle in an attempt to flex his muscles. He decreed “it shall be as such. One limb for each of the men you have dishonoured.” As the peasants pinned Sir John down at his right side. The king began to swing.

Five slices, it took to remove Sir John’s appendages. Unfortunately he died of blood loss at the scene. The king was so excited to have made an example of a senior member of the military that he rode off on his horse with unprecedented haste, swinging the arm &amp; leg around as trophies.

Eight rebel knights and three of their squires decided to hold a ceremony for their departed John. A funeral for a friend. As John’s corpse was being lowered into the grave, his widow came running down from the keep, yelling for the men to stop. 

Thirteen strides, the fair maiden took. All in attempt to hold her beloved once more. She made it to the valley and to her husband. She lay with his dead head in her arms. Love lay bleeding in her hands.

Twenty one years later, the lady Fibonacci was telling the story to her kids, on her deathbed. The legend of sir John and the mockery of the old rule.

"Across the burning desert sand / Wends a lonely caravan / Men and camels, two by two, / Destination:  Timbuktu."

Polite applause.  Then it was the Southern kid's turn.

A King must give his kingdom to one of his sons, he gives them each a duck and a task...
There's a king in a far away kingdom. He had 3 son's all close in age and had not chose an heir. 

The 3 princes were old enough for him to decide, so he gives them each a duck. The king says, " which ever of you sale your duck for the most money will be the heir to the throne. Go my sons fulfill this task."

The eldest prince leaves...

A little later on the middle prince leaves...

Finally the youngest son leaves, as he's walking thru the woods he thinks to himself, "I've never sold a thing in my life, the kingdom could never be mine"

He walks hopelessly around the woods and eventually runs into a beautiful woman bathing in a pond. He is struck. He approaches her and says, "Excuse me ma'am you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I will give you this duck for sex". 

She agrees. 

When they finish he hands her the duck. She looks at the duck confused on what to do with it and says to the prince, "I will return this duck for one more go 'round".

He agrees. 

After they got finished the prince heads back to the kingdom as its getting dark. He feels defeated as he is walking back duck still in hand. 

Suddenly the duck jumps out of his hands and an 18 wheeler suddenly runs it over flat! Devestated he picks up his flat duck. At that moment a guy on a 4 wheeler pulls up and says to the prince holding the flat duck, "Whoa! That's a bad ass duck dude I'll give you 5 dollars!"

The prince agrees and heads back to the kingdom and all the princes meet back with their father. The eldest prince says, "I sold my duck for 1 dollar!" The second goes, "that's nothing I sold mine for 2 dollars!" The third prince smiling, says, "I got fuck for a duck. Duck for a fuck. And 5 dollars for one fucked up duck!"

Three men arrive in Heaven at the same time.
As they approach the Pearly Gates, Saint Peter appears before them. 

"The rules are simple: to get into Heaven, first you have to tell me how you die. If I'm satisfied with your story, you can come in."

The first man steps forward.

"Imagine this. You come home to your sixth-floor apartment to another man's clothes at the foot of you and your wife's bed. I didn't have to imagine, and I didn't stand for it. I had to look for this bastard. So I ran around, searching high and low, until I found someone hanging on to the window sill. I hit his fingers until he falls all six stories but he somehow survives by falling onto some trash bags. I grab the nearest heavy object-which happens to be the refrigerator-and throw it down at him. In my anger, I didn't realize that the plug had wrapped around my ankle, so I ended up falling to my death."

"Well," said Peter, "Normally we don't allow murderers in here, but I think it was for a righteous enough reason. You pass."

As the first man walks into Heaven, the second man steps forward.

"Imagine this. You're a window washer, doing your rounds on the seventh floor of an apartment building. You slip and fall, but somehow you catch yourself on the window sill of the floor below. All of a sudden, this random asshat starts smashing at your fingers. Anyways, I fell and my life flashed before my eyes. By some miraculous fate, I was somehow safe! I had landed on some garbage bags and survived. Then I look up and see a fridge falling from the sky."

Peter laughed. "Well, I don't think you did anything particularly wrong. You can come in."

As the second man entered the gates, Saint Peter turned to the last man. "What about you?"

"So imagine you've just finished fuckin' some dude's wife. Then you hide in the refrigerator."

A chemist and a mathematician are going camping in the woods.
Night begins to fall and the sun starts to set. They begin to get cold and hungry. The mathematician gets the idea to start a campfire for warmth and cooking. The problem is that they do not have any wood. The chemist then suggests to go out and find some loose twigs and burn them.

As they venture out, the chemist hits the jackpot. Hundreds of stumps of wood are stacked up in a pile near their campsite. The difference between this wood is that it’s placed there for campers. None of the wood there came from the trees in the forest that they were camping in. He comes back with some wood and tells the mathematician about it.

“Check this out. I found a huge pile of wood up north of our campsite not very far away. We can take just a few stumps and we will be good for campfire fuel for the rest of the time we are here.”

The mathematician hesitated but the chemist ignores him and continues to take wood from the mysterious free pile.

When the chemist gets back he sees the mathematician with some wood and an axe. Curious about what’s going on the chemist asks him about it.

Chemist: “Where did you get that wood? Why do you have an axe with you?”

Mathematician: “I used the axe to get some wood from some nearby trees.”

Chemist: “You’re killing trees for no reason. Why wouldn’t you just take from the abundance of wood in the huge pile that I’ve been getting it from?”

Mathematician: “Because I prefer natural logs.”

Is sex work?
A U.S. Marine Colonel was about to start the morning briefing to his
staff. While waiting for the coffee machine to finish its brewing, the
colonel decided to pose a question to all assembled.

He explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and
he failed to get his usual amount of sound sleep. He posed the
question of just how much of sex was "work" and how much of it was
"pleasure?" A Major chimed in with 25-75% in favor of work . 
A Captain said it was 50-50%. A lieutenant responded with 25-75% in
favor of pleasure , depending upon his state of inebriation at the
time.

There being no consensus, the colonel turned to the PFC (Private First Class) who was in
charge of making the coffee. What was HIS opinion?

Without any hesitation, the young PFC responded, "Sir, it has to be
100% pleasure."

The colonel was surprised and, as you might guess, asked why.

"Well, sir, if there was any work involved, the officers would have me
doing it for them."

Parish Priest
The parish priest went on a fishing trip.

On the last day of his trip he hooked a monster fish and proceeded to reel it in.

The guide, holding a net, yelled, 'Look at the size of that Son of a B#tch!'

'Son, I'm a priest. Your language is uncalled for!'

'No, Father, that's what kind of fish it is - a Son of a B#tch fish!'

'Really? Well then, help me land this Son of a B#tch!'

Once in the boat, they marveled at the size of the monster.

'Father, that's the biggest Son of a B#tch I've ever seen'

'Yes, it is a big Son of a B#tch. What should I do with it?'

'Why, eat it, of course. You've never tasted anything as good as Son of a B#tch!'

Elated, the priest headed home to the rectory.

While unloading his gear and his prize catch, Sister Mary inquired about his trip.

'Take a look at this big Son of a B#tch I caught!'

Sister Mary gasped and clutched her rosary, 'Father!'

'It's OK, Sister. That's what kind of fish it is, a Son of a B#tch fish!'

'Oh, well then, what are you going to do with that big Son of a B#tch?'

Sister Mary informed the priest that the new Bishop was scheduled to visit in a few days and that they should fix the Son of a B#tch for his dinner.

'I'll even clean the Son of a B#tch', she said.

As she was cleaning the huge fish, the Friar walked in.

'What are you doing Sister?'

'Father wants me to clean this big Son of a B#tch for the new Bishop's Dinner'

'Sister! I'll clean it if you're so upset! Please watch your language!'

'No, no, no, it's called a Son of a B#tch Fish.'

'Really? Well, in that case, I'll fix up a great meal to go with it, and that Son of a B#tch can be the main course!

Let me know when you've finished cleaning that Son of a B#tch.'

On the night of the new Bishop's visit, everything was perfect. The Friar had prepared an excellent meal. The wine was fine, and the fish was excellent.

The new Bishop said, 'This is great fish, where did you get it?'

'I caught that Son of a B#tch!' proclaimed the proud priest.

'And I cleaned the Son of a B#tch!' exclaimed the Sister.

The Friar added, 'And I prepared the Son of a B#tch, using a special recipe!

The new Bishop looked around at each of them. A big smile crept across his face as he said, 'You mother f---ers are my kind of people!'

An old man was on his death bed. He wanted badly to take some of his money with him. He called his priest, his doctor and his lawyer to his bedside. "Here's $30,000 cash to be held by each of you. I trust you to put this in my coffin when I die so I can take all my money with me."
At the funeral, each man put an envelope in the coffin. Riding away in a limousine, the priest suddenly broke into tears and confessed, "I had only put $20,000 into the envelope because I needed $10,000 for a new baptistery." 

"Well, since we're confiding in each other," said the doctor, "I only put $10,000 in the envelope because we needed a new machine at the hospital which cost $20,000." 

The lawyer was aghast. "I'm ashamed of both of you," he exclaimed. "I want it known that when I put my envelope in that coffin, it held my personal check for the full $30,000."

"Twenty-four dollars."

"Expensive, but ok," he thought.

All that remained was the size, but he hadn't the faintest idea.

"Now sir, are they the size a pair of melons? Coconuts? Grape fruits? Oranges?"

"No," he said, "nothing like that."

"Come on, sir, think. There must be something your wife's bust resembles."

Joe's wife was sick. Very sick. None of the doctors could figure out what was wrong with her.
He was about to go into her room and visit her when her doctor approached him.

The doctor said, "These might be her last few days, so you should do whatever she asks of you, so that she may die happy."

Well... Joe thought this over and decided that that was a great idea. He went in and they talked for about 3 hours.

After awhile he asked her if there was anything that he could do for her. She thought for a little bit and said, "Make love to me. Eat my pussy.... Fuck me like you never have before..."

He thought this was a little much in her condition, but since It might be one of the last times he sees her he decided to comply.

The next day he came in, and her doctor said that she was much better, and he should do whatever he did yesterday.
Well.. he walked in and they talked, and she requested they make passionate love again, and again he complied.

After about 5 days of this she had fully recovered, and was able to go home. She walked into the living room to find that Joe was crying.

She said, "What's the matter? I'm fine now. You have nothing to worry about."

He replied, "I know, but all this time I can't stop thinking that I should have saved your sister."

A suspected Covid-19 male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose.
A young student female nurse appears and gives him a partial sponge bath. 
"Nurse,"' he mumbles from behind the mask, "are my testicles black?"
Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet."
He struggles to ask again, "Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?"
Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and
pulls back the covers.
She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other.
She looks very closely and says, "There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look fine."
The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly,
"Thank you very much. That was wonderful. Now listen very, very, closely:

"Are - my - test - results - back?"

Axl pipes up “You are the ‘exciting surprise’? Who the hell organized this event?”

Bon adds “Yeah you guys had like one hit song, and it was all thanks to a movie.”

Little Kevin had a habit of stealing apples from his neighbors farm
Annoyed by this the neighbor tried to catch little Kevin but constantly failed, so he hired a wise man to help him. The wise man simply painted a few words on a sign and left, the sign now said "one apple is poisoned". The next day the neighbor comes out to the wise mans house and asks for his money back, the wise man confused asks whether his apples were stolen, the neighbor replied that they hadn't, then why do you want your money back?

“ I want it be a girl named Doo and I want her to have blond hair and love science.”

“Ok”, said the man, “ but I need a Magical mushroom from this area in the Amazon forest”

He handed them a photo of the mushroom and they set off. They searched and searched in the forest but they couldn’t find it so they picked one that looked similar to it.

They came back to him with the mushroom.

“Steve this mushroom isn’t exactly the same but we couldn’t find anything else, will it work.”

The magician smiled and said, “I can make Doo”.

Tarzan knew nothing about sex when he met Jane
So Jane decide to teach him in a way that he would understand.
"listen Tarzan, what you've got between your legs is a dirty rag and what I have between my legs is a washing machine. So you just have to wash your rag in my washing machine."
Tarzan began to grow extremely fond of his newfound sexuality and on a normal day he would "wash" his rag over 30 times!
Jane became exhausted and decided to avoid Tarzan whenever he was horny. At first Tarzan was confused and angry so he retreated into the jungle.. After some time Jane was again in need of the D but could not find Tarzan anywhere. After a long search she found him and asked him where had he been and why hadn't he searched for her washing machine anymore...
He replied: "Tarzan learn to wash by hand"

Mississippi Grandma

Lawyers should never ask a Mississippi grandma a question if they aren't prepared for the answer.

In a trial, a Southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, 'Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,

'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.'​​​​​​​

Well, I don't drink anymore.
To be fair, I don't drink any less.

On a beautiful lake in the middle of a forest...
is a small water strider minding its own business. Right above him, on a small branch sits a spider.
"Oh boy, I'm totally jumping down there and have that water strider for breakfast!" it thinks.

Right under the surface swims a fish. "Yummy, when the spider jumps down on the water strider, I'm gonna shoot up and eat them both!"

Close to the shore lurks a bear. "When the spider jumps down on the water strider, and the fish shoots out of the water, I'm gonna catch it midair and have a nice meal!"

On the other side of the lake patiently waits a hunter. "When the spider jumps down on the water strider, and the fish shoots up to eat them both, and the bear comes out to catch the fish, I'll shoot the bear!"

Next to the hunter sits a small, tiny mouse. "When the spider eats the water strider, and the fish the spider, and the bear the fish, and the hunter shoots the bear, he'll be distracted so I can steal the cheese sandwich from his bag.

Next to the mouse sneaks a cat. "When the spider gets the water strider, the fish the spider, the bear the fish, the hunter the bear, then the mouse will come out so I can catch it!"

All is thought and done. The spider jumps down and catches the water strider. Suddenly, the fish shoots up and catches them both, only to be caught midair by the bear. The hunter aims and shoots the bear. The mouse snatches the cheese. The cat runs to the mouse, trys to catch it, misses and falls straight into the lake.

An elderly married couple goes to the state fair...
They've been going to this fair since the fifties. Some time in the late sixties-early seventies the fair started offering helicopter rides.

Year after year, Ethel would ask Lester "Honey, can we go on a helicopter ride?"

Being brought up during the Great Depression his reply was always "Honey, that ride is twenty dollars, and twenty dollars is twenty dollars."

This time, the man running the helicopter rides overhears the conversation and chimes in "Look, you two have been coming here year after year and never once have you taken a ride. Tell you what: I'll make you a deal. If I take you on a ride, and you can manage to stay silent the entire time, it's on the house."

Ethel exclaims "Oh please Lester! I can be quiet, and I know you can. Let's face it, we're both getting on in years, this could be our last chance!"

Lester relents, and agrees.

They climb into the helicopter and the pilot takes off. He does everything he can to get a reaction from the two. Going up, down, side to side... If you could do a barrel roll in a helicopter, he'd've done it. When their time is up, he starts letting the copter down and prepares to land, saying "I'm pretty impressed. I did things that even scared me, but you two didn't make a peep. Congratulations, this one's on me."

To which Lester replies "yeah, I almost said something when Ethel fell out, but twenty dollars is twenty dollars."

Fifty priests on a tour bus died in a highway accident. long

And take that deaf bastard with you."

Putting the cat out
My husband and I were dressed and ready to go out for a lovely evening of dinner and theater. Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and then put the cat in the backyard. When our Uber arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our parakeet we didn't want to leave them unchaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again. Because I didn't want the Uber driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. 

A few minutes later he got into the Uber all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the car pulled away, "Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and I had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so I grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat ass down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again." 

The silence in the Uber was deafening.....

She pulled down her pants and...She had a pecker, Mike! She had this great BIG pecker! And I can't swim Mike! I can't swim!"

The newly crowned king got COVID-19!
It was during his coronation.

A plane with five passengers on board is about to crash. There are only four parachutes. The passengers include Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Justin Trudeau, and a young schoolboy.
Trump reaches for a parachute, saying "I have to get out of here alive. If America has no leader, the whole world will fall into chaos!"

Trudeau slaps his hand away. "That's no way to behave. We're all heads of democracies here, we should solve this democratically. Besides, Canada needs a leader much more than the US does."

"You're both nuts." Macron interjects. "We don't have anyone to represent us, which is important, seeing as to how we're all the heads of *republics*. Besides, France is more important than either of your countries."

"Germany is the leader of the free world." Merkel replies. "If I'm gone, there is no free world. So I should get a parachute."

The schoolboy clears his throat. "I-"

"Not now, kid. Germany, the head of the free world? I've never heard a more bold-faced lie in all my life!"

"You ought to know, you've told enough of them."

"Gentlemen, please, this is very simple. We're all leaders, we'll just all take a parachute and leave the kid." 

"*Lady* and gentlemen."

"Whatever. So who's first?"

"Me, of course."

"No, me!"

"Over my dead body!"

"You want to arrange that?"

"I'll have you know, that means war! You don't want to fight us!"

"Yeah? We'll see about-"

*BOOM*

The kid, hanging on from his parachute, watches as the plane crashes into the ground, the politicians still squabbling inside. "I tried to tell them." He thinks aloud to himself. "The number of times I've been through this gag, of course I brought my own."

He's a broker for luxury yachts, and really has a knack for it. He's doing so well that the last woman he was dating he up and just gave her a freaking boat!".

Believe it or not though, my son is doing even better! He's a top ranked national realtor and had such a profitable year that he up and bought this girl he's been dating an entire freaking house!" He drives his shot almost to the hole and all three walk down to meet the friend that lost his ball in the trees.

"Can I ask why that man was paid $85 more than me?" Jane asked the attendant.  "Well...." replied the attendant "we are not just a blood bank but also a sperm bank and one of the most highly regarded in the city.  if the sperm is from the right type of donor, for example dark hair, over 6 foot tall and has a college degree then we will actually pay $100."
"That's so interesting... I never even new that was a thing" thanked Jane as she was leaving.    

Later that afternoon Jane came back into the centre and made her way to the front desk, the attendant was still working and recognised her from their earlier chat.  "Hey, back again so soon?" he asked.  "Mmm hmmm" nodded Jane.

Blind pilots
A plane is preparing for takeoff with a full load of passengers when the pilot and copilot board--both with dark sunglasses and tapping walking sticks for guidance. The passengers are understandably uncomfortable, but assume it must be some sort of practical joke, so they say nothing.

As the plane begins to accelerate, the passengers see the end of the runway rapidly approaching, with certain doom awaiting at the end if the pilots really can't see what they're doing. Just before the end of the runway, all the passengers scream together--right before the plane lifts off. They're a little upset, but relieved that the pilots aren't really blind.

In the cockpit, the pilot turned to his copilot and remarked: "you know, Lou, one of these days they're not going to scream in time, and then we'll be in real trouble!"

A married couple was in a terrible accident...
A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman's face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin.

However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.

After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before! All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty! One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you."

"My darling," he replied, "think nothing of it. I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek."

Why I fired my secretary
Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, 
"Happy Birthday!", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone "Happy Birthday." 

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 
"Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!" 
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, "You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me." 

I said, "Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!"

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, "You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?" 

I responded, "I guess not. What do you have in mind?" 
She said, "Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner."

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 
"Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back."

"Okay," I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake. 

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing "Happy birthday".
And I just sat there...

On the couch...

Sobbing...

Naked...

and erect.

A Texan cattle rancher was in New Zealand
and visited a local pub in a sheep farming area of the South Island. He struck up a conversation with a sheep farmer in the pub. After a bit of chit chat, the Texan asked the Kiwi a question. The conversation went thus:

Texan - “So, how long does it take you to go from one end of your farm to the other”.

Kiwi – “about 3 hours to walk from one end to the other”

Texan – “If I get in my car to drive from one end of my ranch to the other, it’ll take me a day”

Kiwi, after some pause for thought – “Yeah Bro, I used to have a car like that.”

It’s the end of the world as we know it

He´s slowly walking through the wood when he spots one. He aims at the bear and shoots, but he misses. The bear notices him, quicly runs to him and says "you son of a bitch" before fucking him in the ass.

The hunter spends a week in the hospital and decides to go back and finish the job, only this time, he takes a machine gun with him to do it. He finds the bear again, he aims at him.....but  the machinegun jams. The bear notices him, quickly runs to him and rapes him again.

Now he has to spend a month in the hospital. He decides to go back and finally do this thing. He buys a rocket launcher, climbs up a hunting tower in the woods and just patiently waits for the bear. Finally he sees him. He takes the rocket launcher, aims at the bear and shoots....the bear sees the rocket coming, he just moves his head a little, dodging the rocket which explodes behind him. He climbs up the hunting tower, his dick hard again he takes a good look at the hunter and says

On the third day out, the camel suddenly dropped dead without warning.

After dusting themselves off, the Nun and the Priest surveyed their situation. After a long period of silence, the Priest spoke, “Well, Sister, this looks pretty grim.”

“I know, Father. In fact, I don’t think it likely that we can survive more than a day or two.”

“I agree,” says the Father. “Sister, since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me?”

“Anything, Father.”

“I have never seen a woman’s breasts and I was wondering if I might see yours…”

“Well, under the circumstances I don’t see that it would do any harm.”

The Nun opened her habit and the Priest enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty.

“Sister, would you mind if I touched them?”

She consented and he fondled them for several minutes.

“Father, could I ask something of you?”

“Yes, Sister?”

“I have never seen a man’s penis. Could I see yours?”

“I suppose that would be OK,” the Priest replied lifting his robe.

“Oh Father, may I touch it?”

The priest consented and after a few minutes of fondling he was sporting a huge erection.

“Sister, you know that if I insert my penis in the right place, it can give life.”

“Is that true Father?”

"Yes, it is, Sister.”

“Oh Father, that’s wonderful… stick it in the camel and let’s get the hell out of here!”

 -It all started when we were getting married, we made the vows, we kissed and then we finished the wedding, then we went to a carriage on the way to our house for our honeymoon and the horse was a beautiful white color.

 After walking for a while, the horse trips and my husband screams:

¡ONE! 

I look at him in a weird manner  but then I do not take much importance  

We keep walking for another 10 minutes and the horse stumbles again and my husband screams:   

 ¡TWO! 

I look at him worried but I still enjoy the trip. after almost a mile the horse stumbles again and my husband yells 

¡THREE!

 And he takes out a baseball bat from the back and hits the horse on the head 3 times, to which I react in a horrible way, and I say:

 - How can you think of doing that, you are a bastard!

A Polish man married a Canadian girl after he had been in Canada a year or so; and, although his English was far from perfect, they got along very well.

The lawyer said that the speed for getting a divorce would depend on the circumstances, and asked him the following questions:

LAWYER: "Have you any grounds?"

POLE: "JA, JA, an acre and half and a nice little home with 3 bedrooms."

LAWYER: "No," I mean what is the foundation of this case?"

POLE: "It is made of concrete, brick, and mortar," he responded.


 
LAWYER: "Does either of you have a real grudge?"

POLE: "No," he replied, "we have a two-car carport, and have never really needed one."

LAWYER: "I mean, What are your relations like?"

POLE: "All my relations are in Poland ."

LAWYER: "Is there any infidelity in your marriage?"

POLE: "Yes, we have hi fidelity stereo set &amp; DVD player with 6.1 sound. We don't necessarily like the music, but the answer to your questions is yes."

LAWYER: "No, I mean Does your wife beat you up?"

POLE: "NO, I'm always up before her."

LAWYER: "Is your wife a nagger?"

POLE: "NO, she white."

LAWYER: "WHY do you want this divorce?"

POLE: "She going to kill me."

LAWYER: "What makes you think that?"

POLE: "I got proof."

LAWYER: "What kind of proof?"

It's been years since they've seen each other, and after he joyfully picks her up at the airport, he brings her to his home, where his two children are playing.

"Oh," the mother says. "One child is black... and the other is red-haired." She paused. "They must be adopted... I thought you said Tina was pregnant a while back..?"

The son laughed. "Oh, no, mom, they're definitely our kids. Both of ours." 

"They are? How are you, uh..." she paused again, unable to believe her son wasn't *getting it.* "How are you sure they're yours?" 

"Simple," the son said. "Tina and I procreated. When the baby came out red-haired, she said that she used to sit by the window and watch red-haired construction workers across the street, and that's why the baby turned out red-haired. A year later, when she got pregnant, she was sitting by the window and saw a black mailman delivering mail across the street, so naturally, the kid came out black."

The mother nodded her head. "Yes, I see now. When I had just gotten married, living on the farm with your father, I used to sit by the window and watch a jackass roam about the farm."

Then she hid under the bed to see his reaction. After a short while the husband comes home and she could hear him in the kitchen before he came into the bedroom. She could see him walk towards the dresser and pick up the note. After a few minutes he wrote something on it before picking up the phone and calling someone... "She's finally gone...yeah I know, about bloody time, I'm coming to see you, put on that sexy french nightie. I love you...can't wait to see you...we'll do all the naughty things you like." He hung up, grabbed his keys and left. She heard the car drive off as she came out from under the bed. Seething with rage and with tears in her eyes she grabbed the note to see what he wrote...

Lockdown in Russia
Lockdown in Russia, the '50s. Interdiction to be out between 21:00 and 6:00. 2 military men see some guy sneaking. One of them takes out his gun and shoots him.

I was just wondering how different professions have given us words and phrases that mean sex, sexual positions or related to sex
Carpenter or other handy man - screw, bang, pound, nail, lay, grease, hose, pile, hammer, pipe

Sportsmen - score, hit, home run, game, ball, balls deep, knock it out

zookeeper or animal lover - hump, bone, beast, doggy style, monkey love, ram, raw dog

singers and other musical - get it on, make whoopie, get lucky, beat it, rock and roll, afternoon delight

cowboy - cowgirl, ride

archaeologist - dig out

butcher - pork, sausage, hide the salami

doctor and teacher- spank

and of course how could I miss the profession that has given us one of the most used sexual terms used in recent history

A man hears a voice in his head...
*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

"What a weird thing to think." says the man to himself as he works at his desk.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

The voice persistently states as he drives home. The man again ignores it and kisses his wife hello.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

He hears it as he's eating his dinner. His wife asks him what is wrong. "Nothing honey, just have some work things on my mind."

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

He wakes up in the middle of the night, the voice becomes louder and louder.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

He can no longer sleep. He feels like a zombie as he drives into work.

*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.*

The man brings his life savings to the window and gets a $100,000 chip.

*Go to the third roulette wheel.*

He almost runs to the third roulette wheel.

*Put the chip on green 00.*

The man puts the $100K chip on 00, the roulette croupier looks stunned and announces "We have a gambler here, folks." and throws the ball in the wheel.

The wheel spins, the ball bounces, and slowly, slowly the ball drops on Red 25.

A young woman had a habit of doing naked gymnastics in the living room in the afternoon
One day she decided to try a a split, thereby creating a vacuum which sucked her firmly to the tile floor. In spite of all her attempts, she couldn't free herself and had to wait for her husband to come home.

When he got there, he pulled as hard as he could, too. But she remained completely stuck. So they decided to call the doctor.

The doctor came, but couldn't get her off the floor, either. So he suggested calling a tiler.

The tiler came and quickly offered a solution: "We have to break the tile she's on."

"NO WAY, " the husband yelled - "those tiles are 100 dollars a piece. There must be another way?".

"Well," said the tiler. "You could kiss and caress her all over her body."

"Will that free her?" the husband wondered.

no, but then we can slide her into the kitchen, where your tiles are only $2.50 a piece

Problem at the airport
Mr and Mrs Smith were going on holiday to Spain. As usual there was lots of traffic on the motorway, and they only just got to the airport on time. They parked the car, got out their suitcases, and took the bus to the terminal. At last they reached the check-in desk. 

   As they got there, Mr. Smith turned to his wife and said. "I wish I'd brought the piano with us !"

   "The piano ?!??" she replied. "Are you stupid? We can't take the piano on the plane."

   "No, I know. But I've just remembered that I left the tickets on the piano...."

The doctor says, "I see. Take these pills and come back next week."

The next week the old lady returns. "Doctor," she says, "I don't know what the hell you gave me, but now I can hear my farts, but they still don't stink"

"If you can hear it, but can't smell it", the doctor says as he puts on a thick face mask, goggles and gloves, "you have COVID-19."

Married couple couldn’t sleep
There was once this married couple that lived next to a farm. 

They’ve always wanted to live in a rural area because it would allow them to escape the madness of a big boomin’ city. 

However, one night when they were sleeping, a rooster starting going crazy and making all of this noise. This noise was nonstop and kept the couple up all night. This would continue for days on end. 

On the 6th day, the rooster started going crazy again and making all of this noise. So the husband got outta bed and went to go talk to the farmer to see if he could do anything about it. 

The farmer did nothing. 

On the 7th day, the rooster started going crazy again and making all of this noise. The husband then gets ready to go over to the farmer again but the wife stops him. She says, “Hey Sweetie I got this. Go back to bed.”

So the wife gets up and heads over to the farm. 

Twenty minutes later she comes back and goes to sleep. The rooster didn’t make any more noise for the rest of the night and wouldn’t make noise for the months to come. 

One day the husband asked the wife, “hey how did you ever get that rooster to stop making all of that noise?”

And the wife said, “Honey, talking to the farmer was pointless. Everyone knows there’s only one true way to quiet a raging cock...you strangle it till blood comes out.”

In the draw down of WWII...
Dignitaries and generals were touring Nazi facilities in Europe. One of the stops that they made was at a naval base where the dreaded U-Boats were based. 

The dignitaries and their staffs were headed to a captured U-Boat, when a droning was noticed, and the air raid sirens went off. The Luftwaffe planes barreled towards the crowd, opening up their machine guns.

The crowd ran and quickly got into the U-Boat, but General Patton was in the back, and the Allied Captain of the U-Boat wanted to make sure that all of the dignitaries were on board before escaping below the waters. He sent a young Boatswain's Mate to count and verify all of the saviors of Europe were on board.

"Churchill! Eisenhower! Montgomery! Zhukov!" he yelled as he checked off the names. After a long pause, he grew concerned as one name was missing. Puffing, the final General clamored down the ladder.

"PATTON, DOWN THE HATCHES!"

The U-Boat pulled away and slid beneath the waters.

A Blonde and A lawyer.
A lawyer and a blonde are waiting at the airport next to each other.  The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game of Find the Answer.  The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.  The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. 

 He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vice versa.  " Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep.  The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."  This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. 

 The lawyer asks the first question.  "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"  The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. 

 "Okay" says the lawyer, "your turn."  

She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"  

The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer.  He searches on the airport wifi, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail.  After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00. 

 The blonde says, "Thank you," and turns back to get some more sleep.  

The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?"  

Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.

“Well, I’ll tell you” the farmer replied. “One day I was plowing my field and the tractor turned over and pinned me underneath. That pig ran for help. He saved my life”.

“Oh, that’s how he lost his leg?” the neighbor drawled.

“No. One night my wife and I were sound asleep and the house caught on fire. That pig woke us up. He saved our lives!”

“So that’s how he lost his leg”, stated the neighbor.

“No, that wasn’t it” the farmer affirmed.

Exasperated, the neighbor demanded “Then how did he lose his leg?” and the farmer replied, “When you have a pig that good, you don’t eat him all at once!”

I met an older woman at a bar last night. She looked pretty good for a 60-year-old. In fact, she wasn't too bad at all, and I found myself thinking she probably had a really hot daughter. We drank a couple of beers, and she asked if I'd ever had a Sportsman's Double? 'What's that? I asked. 'It's a mother and daughter threesome,' she said. As my mind began to embrace the idea, and I wondered what her daughter might look like, I said, 'No, I haven't.' We drank a bit more, then she said with a wink, 'tonight's your lucky night'. We went back to her place. We walked in. She put on the hall light and shouted upstairs: 'Mom...you still awake?'

There once was a man who owned a sausage factory, and he was showing his arrogant preppy son around his factory.
Try as he might to impress his snobbish son, his son would just sneer.

They approached the heart of the factory, where the father thought, "This should impress him!"

He showed his son a machine and said, "Son, this is the heart of the factory. With this machine here we can put in a pig, and out come sausages."

The prudish son, unimpressed, said, "Yes, but do you have a machine where you can put in a sausage and out comes a pig?"

The father, furious, thought and said, "Yes son, we call it your mother."

Tribe chief comes up to the first explorer and asks him “Knuuga, or death?”

Explorer says “I don’t know what knuuga is but it surely has to be better than death” and so picks the first option. 

Chief goes on a platform and screams “Knuuga!”

A giant man with a 10 inch dick comes out of a tent and starts relentlessly fucking the first explorer for hours. 

After they’re done, the chief goes up to the second explorer and gives the same two options. 

Seeing what happened to his friend, the explorer says “I’d rather pick death than be fucked by that thing for hours, I pick death”. 

Chief nods, and goes on the platform again. He says “Knuuga! Until death!”

I'm a bit cross
The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent virus threat and have therefore raised their threat level from “Miffed” to “Peeved.” Soon, though, level may be raised yet again to “Irritated” or even “A Bit Cross.”

The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out.

The virus has been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let's Get the Bastard.” They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.”

The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.”

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from “No worries” to “She'll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.

The Russians have said “Its not us”

Stomach Pains
A man goes to the doctor with sever pain in his stomach. The doctor looks him over and delivers the prognosis. 

"Sir. You are infected with a very large tapeworm. It's larger than I've ever seen and I fear traditional medicine will not help you get rid of it. I know how to get rid of it, but you'll have to trust me because my method will sound a little unorthodox."

"Ok, Doc. What should we do?" says the man. 

"Come back to my office tomorrow and bring with you a banana and a snickers bar."

The man looks confused but agrees. He returns the next day with the banana and a Snickers bar. 

He is instructed to disrobe and bend over. The doctor then takes the banana, shoves it up the mans ass and waits 60 seconds. Then he takes the Snickers bar and shoves it up the man's ass and waits 60 seconds. 

"Ok sir. Come back tomorrow at the same time with the same items."

The next day, the man returns and the doctor repeats the same procedure. This goes on for 5 more days until the man is about to break. 

"Doctor! Please! How long must we do this for?"

The Doctor apologizes for the man's discomfort but reassures him that tomorrow will be his last appointment. He said to come back at the same time but this time to bring a banana, a Snickers bar and a hammer. 

"A hammer?" says the man, shaking. 

"Yes. Just trust me." say the Doctor. 

The next day the man returns with the banana, the Snickers and the hammer. The doctor asks him again to disrobe and bend over and proceeds to shove the banana up the man's ass. He waits 60 seconds.....120 seconds......3 minutes......5 minutes. 

"Well doctor? Are you going to use the snickers?"

"Just be patient." Says the doctor. 

Just then, the worm pops his head out of the man's ass and says "Where the hell is my Snickers?" and the doctor grabs the hammer and SMASHES HIM!

Peanuts as present
A bus driver was driving a whole tour bus of elderly men and women down a highway. As he was driving one of the little old ladies tapped him on the shoulder to offer him a handful of peanuts that he gratefully accepted.

15 minutes pass and she comes back with another handful of peanuts. This happens about five more times. The bus driver finally decides to ask her, “Why don't you eat the peanuts yourself?” She replied and said “We have no teeth so we aren't able to chew them.”

Confused, he asks, “If you can't chew them, why do you buy them?” She replied “We get them just for the chocolate around them. We love it!”

A taxi driver in a rush is speeding through town.

Taxi driver: "Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I'm in a big rush to get my next customer, please do not call the cops. I can't lose my license over this! I would be willing to pay you 50 bucks."

The cyclist ignores his proposition and yells: "Peter! Peter, quick! Call the police. Please hurry, Peter!"

Panicking, the taxi driver increases his offer: "Alright, alright, alright! I'll give you 200 bucks. Just please do not involve the cops. I'm depending on this job!"

With no interest still, the cyclist yells again: "Did you call the police already, Peter? Please hurry, Peter. Call the cops!"

Calculating the most money he can spend at the moment, the taxi driver desperately makes his final offer: "Alright, listen pal. I'm willing to give you $1000 for this. It's all I can afford and I will probably not have enough for food this month. Please, I'm begging you!"

Even still, the cyclist stays stubborn and yells at his partner to call the police. Now the taxi driver is furious about the stubbornness and cusses: "You know what? Fuck both of you! You can suck my fucking dick!"

With wide open eyes, the cyclist looks at the taxi driver and shouts: "PETER! PETER!! Hang up immediately, he's trying to negotiate!"

When beethoven passed away,
 When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.

 Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. 

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.    When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."

He listened a while longer, and said, "There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling." So the magistrate kept listening; "There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..." 

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing."

"But I need it really bad," said the man.

"Well, why do you need it so badly? asked the doctor.

The man said, “My girlfriend is coming into town on Friday; my ex-wife will be here on Saturday; and my wife is coming home on Sunday. Can't you see? I must have a double dose."

The doctor finally relented saying,"Okay, I'll give it to you, but you have to come in on Monday morning so that I can check you to see if there are any side effects.

"On Monday, the man dragged himself in; his arm in a sling.

The doctor asked, “What happened to you?"

His father explains, “She was conceived during the most bountiful season we had ever seen.”

A breakfast to remember
So I had gone to a Varkala, a beach cliff tourist spot in Kerala, during the vacation and the family was staying at this hotel, considering it was a long awaited vacation,  we went for a nice one with a swimming pool,  near the beach cliff and everything.  So in the morning I had been learning surfing and was tired when I got back. However breakfast wasn't ready yet,  so I decided to swim for a bit. 
Obviously by the time I got out,  I was hungry as hell. Therefore I walk up to the dining pavilion and as soon as I enter,  this bottle of jam rolls up to my feet, POPS up and is like "I loooove your hair". The toasts crackles a  bit and says she finds my calves quite attractive.  I was lost, I was confused I thought I was having a stroke. The boiled eggs all roll up one after the other and start commenting how how wonderful I smell. 

I ran to the manager,  demanding to know what was happening.  He very calmly explained... 

The breakfast was complimentary

Irish drinking

A group of American tourists came in a pub in Cork, Ireland.

One of the Americans said, in a loud voice, -"I hear you Irish think you're great drinkers. I bet $5,000 that no one here can drink 20 pints of Guinness in 30 minutes." 

The bar was silent, but the American noticed one Irishman leaving. No one took up the bet. 

Forty minutes later, the Irishman who had left returned and said, -"Hey Yank, is yer bet still on?" 

-"Sure!"- said the American, -"20 pints in 30 minutes for a bet of $5,000." 

-"Grand!"- replied the Irishman, -"So pour the pints and start the clock." 

It was very close but the last drop was consumed with 2 seconds to spare. 

-"OK, Yank, pay up."- said the Irishman. 

-"I'm happy to pay, here's your money."-
said the American. -"But tell me, when I first offered the wager, I saw you leave. Where did you go?”

-"Well mate,"- replied the Irishman, -"$5,000 is a lot of money to a man like me, so I went to the pub across the road to see if I could do

The bartender leaned over, peered at the string for moment and asked, “Aren’t you that string I threw out of here a minute ago?”

The string replied, “Nope, I’m afraid not!”

A pastor’s wife walks into a butcher shop
She sees the most perfect looking cut of meat in the display case and asks the butcher what kind of meat it is. “That’s Dam Ham,” he replies
“I bet your PARDON?!” the lady says, “I am a good Christian woman, and I would kindly ask you not to use that kind of language.” The butcher explains, “Oh no ma’am, I’m not using profanity. Dam Ham is what we call the especially delicious filets we get from the big trout caught down by the dam.” The woman apologizes for the misunderstanding, buys the filet, and goes home. 

Later that evening, her husband comes home from work and asks, “What is that Heavenly smell?” “Thats Dam Ham,” she replies. “Honey! What would the congregation think if they knew their pastor’s wife was speaking in such a way?” “Oh no honey, I would never!” She responds “They call it Dam Ham because it’s a special filet from one of the big trout caught down by the dam.” She finishes dinner and they sit down at the table with their two beautiful children. They join hands and say grace. The husband carves the meat, takes some for himself, then passes the plate to his son. After taking his first bite, the husband says, “Honey, you’ve really outdone yourself. This Dam Ham is delicious! 

“Right on, Dad!” The son says “Now could you pass the fucking potatoes?”

The Professional Boil Sucker
A fellow has developed a nasty boil between his scrotum and anus, and eventually decides he has to see a doctor. The doctor has a look and is shocked by the sight; he says “You've left this too long for me to be able to help, you need to see a Professional Boil Sucker urgently.” 

The doctor arranges an appointment with the leading PBS in the city, who agrees to suck the boil immediately. “Now this bench is fully adjustable..” the PBS explains “you can lay face down, with my chin resting on your scrotum, or you can lay on your back with my chin next to your anus..?”

The patient chooses face down, but being a bit nervous, he inadvertently pops out a tiny fart just as the PBS starts the procedure.

The Professional Boil Sucker reels backwards across the room gagging, equipment crashing to the floor.. “For fucks sake!" he screams "..are trying to make me *sick* or something!?”

I put my best lizard-healer expression on my face and followed
him into his bedroom. One of the little lizards was indeed lying
on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do.

"Honey," I called, "come look at the lizard!"
"Oh, my gosh!" my wife exclaimed. "She's having babies." 

"What?" my son demanded. "But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!"

I was equally outraged.

"Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn't want them
to reproduce," I said accusingly to my wife.

"Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?"
she inquired. (I think she actually said this sarcastically!)

"No, but you were supposed to get two boys!" 

"Yeah, Bert and Ernie!" my son agreed. 

"Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, you know,"
she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm!)

By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was
going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it.

"Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience," I announced. "We're about to witness the miracle of birth."

"Oh, gross!" they shrieked. 

We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked
like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. 

"We don't appear to be making much progress," I noted.

"It's breech," my wife whispered, horrified.

"Do something, Dad!" my son urged.

"Okay, okay." Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot
when it next appeared, giving it a gentle tug. It disappeared.
I tried several more times with the same results.

"Should I call 911?" my eldest daughter wanted to know.

"Maybe they could talk us through the trauma." (You see a
pattern here with the females in my house?)

"Let's get Ernie to the vet," I said grimly. We drove to the vet
with my son holding the cage in his lap.

"Breathe, Ernie, breathe," he urged. 

The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered
at the little animal through a magnifying glass.

"What do you think, Doc, a C-section?" I suggested scientifically.

"Oh, very interesting," he murmured. "Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,
may I speak to you privately for a moment?"

I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.

"Is Ernie going to be okay?" my wife asked.

"Oh, perfectly," the vet assured us. "This lizard is not in labor.
In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen. . Ernie is a boy. You
see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they come
into maturity, like most male species, they um . . um . .. . masturbate. Just the way he did, lying on his back" He blushed, glancing at my wife. 

We were silent,absorbing this.

"So, Ernie's just, just . . . excited," my wife offered.

"Exactly," the vet replied, relieved that we understood. 

More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle.
And giggle. And then even laugh loudly.

Tears were now running down her face. "It's just ... that ...I'm picturing you pulling on its . . . its . . . teeny little . . .."

She gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.

"That's enough," I warned. We thanked the vet and hurriedly bundled the lizard and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay.

"I know Ernie's really thankful for what you did, Dad," he told me.

"Oh, you have NO idea," my wife agreed, collapsing with laughter.

One day a man goes to the doctor to get his stomach checked
The man says "Hey doc, my stomach really hurts."

The doctor gives him a check up and they find out there's a worm in the man's intestine.

The doctor says "Alright all you need to do is to put this biscuit near your ass and maybe you can lure the worm out."

The man without question, heads home and holds a biscuit near his ass hole.

The next day the man comes into the doctors office and says "Doc that didn't work!"

The doctor says he should try it again and maybe the worm will come out.

The man frustrated as he is, heads home and does it again.

The next day the man sees the doctor and says "DOC IT STILL DIDN'T WORK!"

The doctor replies "Maybe the worm wants something else."

The doctor then pulls out an apple and hands it to the man and says "Alright try it with that."

The man heads home and holds the apple up to his ass and suddenly he feels something coming out of his ass hole.

The man screams "What the hell is that?"

Then the worm says "No more biscuits?"

Three men go deer hunting.
They've been out there for hours before one of the men finally sees a buck. 

He shoots the buck and they're tracking  its blood when one of the other guys says "we need to hurry i need to shit."

They proceed to take the dead buck back to camp and start gutting the deer. That's when the other guy said "fuck it, im just going to shit behind that tree. I cant hold it any more"

The two guys are sitting there cleaning the buck still and one of them say. "Hey lets put these guts under him so it looks like he shit his guts out" .

So they snuck over and put the guts under him while he's shitting without him noticing them and went back to wait for him.

What’s worse than finding a worm in your apple?
Being young and naive falling for the one you believe to be your soulmate and spending so much time and effort to get in a relationship with them and when it finally happens you are happy but your partner isn’t, but they don’t actually show it, and it gets to the point where you are now married and have been living together for a year and are now she tells you she’s pregnant, so now you work extra hours and spent long nights planning on how you are going to give the support to the loves of your life and after many brutal months the baby comes out and you are in complete happiness for 15 seconds before you realize something is off, and that something is the baby, you then realize that it’s not yours and you pass out on the floor, everything goes black, everyone is in shock, you wake next to your “wife” and *your* “child” that you just spent so much time and money on, and she tries to explain it was an accident, it was a one time thing, but now you know, that she wasn’t happy all along, so you let her and the child go... you let them move away, but no, they don’t take any of the things you bought for the baby, anything you worked so hard for, for them, they leave you alone with nothing to live for.  But what is left is an apple, an apple that when you take a bite, you find half a worm.

The first contact between space aliens and humans
A space alien asks a human: "Why are so many of humans starving despite that there is plenty of food?"

"We don't have enough money."

"Why are so many humans homeless despite there being enough of homes?"

"We don't have enough money."

"Why are so many people ill despite that there are cures?"

"We don't have enough money."

"You know, maybe if scarcity of this mysterious resource that you call "money" is so big problem for you, then maybe our civilization could somehow help you to get more of it?"

"There is no need, we can print as much money as we want!"

"Okay, thanks for the conversation." Then the alien returns to its spaceship and reports to its boss that there is no sight of intelligent life on Earth.

The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family.

On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, "Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon"

Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale,

"Good morning, Ma'am", he said, "I've come to...

"Oh, no need to explain," Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, "I've been expecting you."

"Have you really?" said the photographer. "Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my speciality?"

"Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat"

After a moment she asked, blushing, "Well, where do we start?"

"Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there."

"Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me!"

"Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results."

"My, that's a lot!" gasped Mrs Smith.

"Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that."

"Don't I know it," said Mrs. Smith quietly.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. "This one was done on the top of a bus," he said.

"Oh my God!" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her chest.

"And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider her mother was so difficult to work with."

"She was difficult?" asked Mrs. Smith.

"Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look."

"Four and five deep?" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

"Yes", the photographer replied. "And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in."

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. "Do you mean they actually chewed on your, um. equipment?"

"It's true, Ma'am, yes. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away."

"Tripod?"

"Oh yes, Ma'am, I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too heavy to be held in the hand very long.

With that, Mrs. Smith fainted.

The bartender looks over at him and notices he’s looking pretty down. Curious, he walks over and nudges him.

“Hey man, what’s wrong? You look upset.”

The man doesn’t answer at first, but after enough prodding, he finally sighs and looks up.

“You know, I’ve built hundreds of bridges, but do they call me the Bridge Builder? No! I’ve negotiated dozens of peace deals, but do they call me the Diplomat? No! I’ve taught thousands of students, but does anyone call me the Teacher? Hell no!”

The man gets steadily more agitated as he speaks until he finally downs the rest of his beer and stares the bartender in the eyes.

“But you fuck ONE goat and suddenly you’re a Goat Fucker all your life.”

An old pub had a dog called Rover
An old pub had a dog called Rover, who all the patrons loved. Unfortunately, one day Rover passed away. To honour the passing of their beloved dog, they cut off his tail and pinned it above the fireplace.

With this, Rover went up to doggy heaven where he was met at the pearly white gates by Saint Peter. As Rover approached the gates, Saint Peter says to him "I'm sorry Rover, I can't let you into doggy heaven unless you are complete. I must send you back down to earth to fetch your tail." Saint Peter then raised his arms and sent Rover back down to earth as a ghost.

By the time Rover reaches the old pub back on earth, it's about 2 am and the pub is shut. Eager to get into heaven, Rover starts barking outside. The landlord wakes up, opens his window, and looks outside at the ghostly dog and asks "Rover? Is that you boy?", "Yes, it is" replied Rover " I've come to get my tail as I am not allowed into heaven without it!" The landlord looks Rover in the eyes and says "I'm sorry boy, but you know the rules... We don't serve spirits after 12"

"Only two pairs of underwear?"

"Yup. I wear one while the other is in the wash."

The man behind the counter looks at him in disgust, then rings out his order.

A second man walks in. "5 pairs of underwear please."

"Only 5 eh?"

"Yeah, I wear one for every weekday, then go commando all the weekend."

The man behind the counter shakes his head. "Well, you're better then the last guy!"

"Wow! You must be really clean!"

Field Trip
A group of 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders, accompanied by two female teachers, 
went on a field trip to the local racetrack, (Churchill Downs ) to learn 
about thoroughbred horses and the supporting industry (Bourbon), but 
mostly to see the horses.

When it was time to take the children to the bathroom, it was decided 
that the girls would go with one teacher and the boys would go with the 
other.




The teacher assigned to the boys was waiting outside the mens room when 
one of the boys came out and told her that none of them could reach the 
urinal.




Having no choice, she went inside, helped the boys with their pants, and 
began hoisting the little boys up one by one, holding on to their 
'wee-wees' to direct the flow away from their clothes.




As she lifted one, she couldn't help but notice that he was unusually 
well endowed. Trying not t o show that she was staring the teacher said, 
'You must be in the 5th grade.'




'No, ma'am', he replied. 'I'm riding Silver Arrow in the seventh race, but I appreciate your help.'

Passenger: 'There are always a few clouds over everybody.

'Cabbie: Not Frank Feldman. He was a terrific athlete. He could have won the Grand-Slam at tennis. He could golf with the pros. He sang like an opera baritone and danced like a Broadway star and you should have heard him play the piano. He was an amazing guy. 

Passenger: Sounds like he was something really special. 

Cabbie: 'There's more. He had a memory like a computer. He remembered everybody's birthday. He knew all about wine, which foods to order and which fork to eat them with. He could fix anything. Not like me. I change a fuse, and the whole street blacks out. But Frank Feldman, could do everything right.

'Passenger: 'Wow, some guy then.' 

Cabbie: 'He always knew the quickest way to go in traffic and avoid traffic jams. Not like me, I always seem to get stuck in them. But Frank, he never made a mistake, and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too.He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Frank Feldman. 

Passenger: 'An amazing fellow. How did you meet him?'

Cabbie: 'Well... I never actually met Frank. He died and I married his fricking wife."

The Croc, a straight edge, yells at the Lizard “What the hell are you doing with your life, wasting it away! Look how high you are, laughing, stoned off your ass! Get your shit together!” The Lizard, looks at the Croc; eyes bloodshot, it’s dazed and confused answers the Croc “Buddy, you think I’m zonked? Go look at the monkey in the tree!” And continues drinking. The Croc heads up to the tree and climbs, gets to the top and the Monkey starts exploding from laughter. Laughs so hard, he falls right off the tree! The Croc goes down and sees the monkey still laughing on the floor, stoned as shit.

The little builder
A cute golden-haired pre-schooler notices that they are building a house next door, and she starts hanging around the site and asking the builders about everything they are doing. They think she's adorable, so they find her a little hard hat and hi-vis, and they set her up in a corner of the yard with a pile of sand and a hosepipe to play with. Every so often one of the builders goes over with a bucket and asks her to "mix up some cement" for them, and she comes back every day for a week so on Friday they all put a pound in an envelope and they tell her it's her "wages", and when her Mummy sees it they go off to the post office to open her first savings account.

The post office lady asks where she got all this money from, and the little girl explains that she has been building a house. "That's nice, will you be building one next week as well?" asks the post office lady. "Yes," says the little girl, "if those wankers at Jewson get their fingers out of their arses in time to get the shit to us by ten, otherwise we might as well all fuck off down the pub."

After 300 kilometres of touring fun, his bike begins to stutter and eventually breaks down. The man finds himself in the middle of nowhere and walks to the nearest farm. The farmer, who is working outside on the land, greets him and asks if he stays for dinner, awaiting the truck who'll pick up his bike for reparation. Eagerly the man agrees. 

Inside he meets the farmers wife and their beautiful daughter. When he walks into the kitchen, he's astounded by the biggest pile of dirty dishes he has ever seen. 'We have one dinner rule', the farmer says. 'Whoever speaks during dinner, has to do the dishes.'

Dinner is served and everyone is enjoying the meal in total silence. When desert comes, the farmers daughter takes off her top, and starts frisking the man. In about two minutes they are making love, right there on the table. Nobody utters a word. 

After they finish, the farmers wife gets under the table, and blows the man like he's never been blown before. Right after she climbs on his lap, and rides him like a bull. Still, nobody has said a word. 

When she's done, the man lights a sigarette and peeks out of the window. He notices it's started drizzling outside, and remembers his bike is out in the open. He jolts up, grabs the vaseline and bolts to the front door, only to find it locked. 

He sprints back into the kitchen, making wild armgestures to the farmer, pointing outside, to the door and to his tiny jar of vaseline. The farmer, white with fear, then says: 'Allright allright, I'll do the dishes!'

My take on a shaggy dog story
A man walks into a bar, orders a pint and sees a sign pinned up above the till - “talking cat, going cheap.”

He calls the barman over and asks him what the deal with the cat is and can he have a look at it. The man shrugs, goes into the back and returns with a mangy old Tom cat.

“Here you go,” says the barman, “have a chat with him yourself. He’s still for sale - five quid.”

“Hello.” Says the cat.
“Wow, you really can talk!” The man says.
“Oh yes, buy me a pint and packet of pork scratchings and I’ll tell you all about it.” So the man buys the cat a pint and some scratchies.
“It all began,” the cat begins after taking a long drink, “back in the 1860s. India, don’t you know. I was The viceroy’s pet. Went everywhere with him, watched the birth of a great nation. Marvellous really. One day I met this ancient yogi who taught me the secrets of the universe - infinite bliss, how to communicate in any language, immortality, the lot. I studied under him for weeks and weeks. Well, after that I couldn’t stay confined to the Raj for much longer and took off on an extended quest; travelled through Asia and ended up in Novograd, Russia. Beastly cold place - don’t go, take it from me. There was this tall beardy chap, Radputin or something his name was. Anyway, I convinced him it would be a grand idea to get in with the tsarina, gullible little thing but quite rich and I’d picked up a liking for caviar and bolly by then. Then I got bored again and wandered off halfway through one of their many parties.”

The cat has another deep drink and looks meaningfully at his nearly empty glass.

“Another one?” The man says.
“Splendid! So, I left the tsars and that wild eyed Georgian fellow to get on with whatever they were doing and made my way along the Danube to Central Europe. Ended up in this coffee shop in Vienna, inhabited by the strangest types. One of them, painter he said he was but they were dreadful really, took kindly to me. I tried to encourage him by shredding his papers and shitting in his shoes but he just got angrier and angrier. One day I brought him back a half dead mouse as a treat and he just flipped, started going on about “untermensch” and “filthy mausen” infesting the land. Quite put the willies up me, so I fucked off again. Luckily Avi Lieberwitz came by just at that moment to check how Ad was doing. I heard them playing about all the way down the road.

I don’t remember much of the next few years- got in with a bad crowd. I started hanging out on this airforce base and some of the yanks there sort of adopted me as a mascot. It was alright I suppose. One night I was out for a stroll when I came upon this great big wall, all grey and new. I hopped up on it to have a look and you wouldn’t believe what I saw on the other side. This whole family was there, hiding in the shadows. The man had a ladder and he placed it up against the wall and held it steady while his wife climbed up. Now I now about ladders - you’re supposed to weave in and out of the bottom rungs, making a yowling noise while it shakes and quivers. I’ve just started my routine when the man goes to kick me - I mean the nerve of him! So I hissed and spit and clawed his shins until he let go of the ladder and it fell with a crash. Then there were all these bright lights and shouting voices so I ran away before the banging started.”

The man is sitting there gobsmacked at this point.

“Ahem.”

“Oh right.” The man gestures for the barman who pours another pint for the cat.

“Go on, what happened next?”
“Really old boy? Ok. So there was this greasy fellow on the airforce base, Elvis something or other. He took me in and when he eventually finished his service he took me back to Tennessee. Great place. Good music, good food, more ladies than you can shake your tail at. Anyway I developed this irritation in my anal glands which left me walking rather oddly. I’d sort of strut, shifting my weight about so as not to leak anywhere. He thought this was great fun, we spent ages together, him with his guitar, me prowling, stiff legged across the floor in time to the beat.”

The cat stopped again.

“I’ve got to go for a slash. Watch my stuff, yeah?”

“Sure, of course!” After the cat has left he calls the barman over again. “This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen! What a life story! And all from a real TALKING cat!”

“Mm. yeah, whatever.” The barman mutters gloomily.

“What are you talking about! This is incredible! Why does no one else know about this?” The man stops and pauses briefly, thinking hard.
“And why are you selling him so cheaply?”

The barman gives a weary sigh and plonks the glass he is polishing down on the bar. He looks over at the man.

“You wanna know why I want rid of him?”

“Yes, of course!”

“Because it’s all bullshit, he never did any of that stuff and the little prick never buys his round.”

During quarantine - Lonely at home
I am lonely at home quarantined:

Day 1. Oh, that's nice.

Day 3. I read books and rest.

Day 5. I bingwatched "Friends".

Day 7. I talked to the washing machine, but I had worse days.

Day 9. My washing machine is angry. I never had worse days.

Day 11. I'm fine… So-so… Probably… Well, I guess according to my cat I am fine.

Day 13. My mind and subconscious mind have been drinking wine for three hours and singing "Star-Spangled Banner".

Day 15. I have no fever. So at least Chocko - my mixer - told me.

Day 17. I befriended the washing machine and finally stopped crying. Now I'm just laughing .. for what I don't know too ...

Day 19. The camel that I grow in my bathroom told me that it was no longer wrapped in one place, so I would walk it a little on the terrace.

Day 21. Dumbledore is in my living room and peels peppers. I am helping him. We're fine.

Day 23. I dreamed of Donald Trump. He told me to not go anywhere, then slapped me and became Kim Jong-Un. I woke up calm.

Day 25. My seven chakras turned out to be fourteen. How did I know? I caught them in my bedroom hugging each other.

Day 32. Today my washing machine, mixer and camel were offended and now no one but the cat is talking to me.

Day 40. Quarantine was extended today. The good news is that the cat caught a mouse that speaks French and cooks. I'm not going to be hungry anymore.

Day 44. Me and the antenna on the top of the roof have a secret connection. Basically, she goes out with the Cable, but what shall I do. Love does not ask.

Day 50. The cat found out about our relationship and told the Cable. No one talks to me now.

Day 98. The aliens came to Earth, but they do not let them in the country, because they do not have Visas and need to be quarantined for 120 days.

Day 108. I came to enlightenment. This isolation helped me connect to space. From there, I was told that Dwayne Johnson and Madonna are KGB agents, and that Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un are Siamese twins, but they do not know that the Lord is American.

Day 110 and ... Is it night ... I ate the cat, mouse and camel. I also tried to eat the mixer, but I broke a tooth.

DAY 120 and… I watched the news… I took a rope and decided to do bungee from the terrace… but… The last thing I hear after it cuts and I break my neck is how they announce that quarantine is lifting…

Day 1 at the hospital. I lie in plaster, and Dumbledore brings me juices and fruit.

Life is good again…

For all I know you could start at any moment. I'll have to take you in and write you up." To which she replies "If you do that I'll have to charge you with sexual assault." "But I haven't even touched you!" says the warden. "That's true," she says "but you have all the equipment...for all I know you could start at any moment." "Have a nice day ma'am" and he left.

A girl with tight skirt tries to get on a bus....
In a crowded city at a busy bus stop, a woman who was waiting for a bus was wearing a tight leather skirt. As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus. 

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't.

 So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more. For the second time she attempted the step, and once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step. 

About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus. She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and screeched, "How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!' The Texan smiled and drawled, "Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we are friends."

Larry replies, “God and I are tight. He knows I have poor eyesight, so He’s fixed it so when I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, poof! The light goes on. When I’m done, poof! The light goes off.”

“Wow, that’s incredible,” the doctor says.

A little later in the day, the doctor calls Larry’s wife.

“Bonnie,” he says, “Larry is doing fine! But I had to call you because I’m in awe of his relationship with God. Is it true that he gets up during the night, and poof, the light goes on in the bathroom, and when he’s done, poof, the light goes off?”

“Oh sweet Jesus”, exclaims Bonnie. “He’s peeing in the refrigerator again!”

Small talk
The year is 2097. In the midst of a nuclear war, two babies are sent from Earth in a pod to an empty SpaceX bunker on Mars in the hopes they will survive and continue the human race.

After years in isolation and with packaged food becoming scarce, the young humans decided to venture out onto the planet’s surface and try to establish a civilization. 

They began drilling through the crust and discovered lakes of water, something they’d never seen before. Soon they were planting crops and irrigating water to the surface where new life forms were created and thriving. 

Then, one day as they were digging up their harvest, one of them noticed something completely foreign and amazing in the sky: A cloud. The human stared in awe at this massive spectacle floating through the barren Mars atmosphere. After a while, the cloud neared and began drizzling water all across their fields.

With haste, the first human raced back to the bunker and exclaimed, “It’s happening, just like the books said it would! It’s raining!”

The second human, not raising his eyes from the paper, lowered his coffee and replied, “We needed it.”

Irish Man
Irish man is stumbling through the woods, totally drunk, when he comes upon a preacher baptizing people in the river.


He proceeds to walk into the water and subsequently bumps into the
preacher... The preacher turns around and is almost overcome by the smell
of alcohol, whereupon he asks the drunk,



'Are you ready to find Jesus?'



The drunk shouts, 'Yes, I am.'



So the preacher grabs him and dunks him in the water.. He pulls him up and
asks the drunk,' Brother have you found Jesus?'



The drunk replies, 'No, OI haven't found Jesus.'



The preacher shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again for a
little longer. He again pulls him out of the water and asks again, 'Have
you found Jesus me brother?'



The drunk again answers, 'No, OI I haven't found Jesus.'



By this time the preacher is at his wits end and dunks the drunk in the
water again --- But this time holds him down for about 30 seconds and when
he begins kicking his arms and legs he pulls him up. The preacher again
asks the drunk, 'For the love of God have you found Jesus?' 





(Are you ready for this????) 



The drunk wipes his eyes and catches his breath and says to the preacher,

Dating
Anna had lost her husband almost four years ago. Her daughter was constantly calling her and urging her to get back into the world. Finally, Anna said she'd go out, but didn't know anyone.

Her daughter immediately replied, "Mum! I have someone for you to meet.."

Well, it was an immediate hit. They took to one another and after dating for six weeks, he asked her to join him for a weekend away.. 


Their first night there, she undressed as he did. There she stood nude, except for a pair of black lacy panties; he was in his birthday suit.

Looking her over, he asked, "Why the black panties?"

She replied: "My breasts you can fondle, my body is yours to explore, but down there I am still in mourning."

He knew he was not getting lucky that night.

The following night was the same- she stood there wearing the black panties, and he was in his birthday suit - but now he was wearing black condom.

She looked at him and asked: "What's with the black condom?"

He replied, "I want to offer my deepest condolences.."

The Devil responds, "No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him."
God demands, "If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!"
The Devil laughs. "Where are you going to get a lawyer?"

Jesus and Moses
Jesus and Moses were sitting up in heaven in the late 70s early 80s looking down on the beaches of California.  Jesus says, “Damn Moses, I’m bored.”  Moses says,”Me too.  it looks like they are having a good time. Let’s go down.”    
So they go down and are walking along the beach with their long hair and flowing robes and they just blend in.  

Jesus says, “Damn Moses I don’t understand, the last time I was down here people would gather around and praise me.”  Moses said, “I know me too.  Watch this I’ll show them.”    
He walks over, grabs a frisbee And throws it out in the ocean.  Walk up to the water, raises his hands and parts the water.  He walks out picks up the frisbee, walks back to shore and everyone says, “ Yeah Moses.”   
Jesus says that’s pretty good Moses, but watch this.”  He grabs the frisbee, throws it out in the ocean, takes off running across the water and just sinks.    
Moses walks up to water, raises his hands, parts the water, pulls Jesus up on shore, and pumps the water out of him.  Jesus wakes up looks at Moses and says,”I don’t understand Moses, the last time I was down here I used to do this all the time.”    
Moses says, “SURE JUSES, BUT THAT’S BEFORE YOU HAD THE HOLES IN YOUR FEET.”

A gay couple had been partnered for 25 years and was celebrating the 60th birthday of one of them. During the party, a fairy appeared and said that because they had been such a loving couple all those years, she would give them one wish each. The one who was giving the party said, "We've blown all our money on parties and fine dining and decorating this house, I've never gotten to see the world. I wish we could travel all over the world." The fairy waved her wand and POOF! He had the tickets in his hand. Next, it was the birthday boy's turn. He paused for a moment, and then with a sly grin said, "Well, I'd like a boyfriend 30 years younger than me." The fairy waved her wand and POOF! He was 90.

and take a look at his bike when the mechanic shouted across the garage..

"Hey, Doc, want to take a look at this?"

The cardiologist, a bit surprised, walked over to where the mechanic 
was working on the motorcycle.

The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag
and asked, "So Doc, look at this engine. I open its' heart, take the valves out,
repair any damage, and then put them back in, and when I finish, it works 
just like new. So how come I make $39,675 a year and you get the

An insecure engaged man wants to prove his devotion
An insecure engaged man wants to prove his devotion to his wife by getting her name tattooed on his penis. His fiance has been with many black men and he felt like he couldn't measure up to them.

He went to his local parlor and explained his idea, and the tattoo artist said "I've done this before, you'll need to become erect." The artist gave him some mags and twenty minutes later, the man had WENDY up his shaft. Afterwards, he noticed he could only see W-Y while not erect. He shrugged it off, thinking she would only see it while he's aroused.

Excited to have an intimate night, he took his fiance out to a fancy dinner to set the mood. After a drink he excused himself to the restroom, stood in the middle of three urinals and went. A large black man then took the urinal next to him, and followed suit. Difficult to resist, the man took a quick peek at the black man's dong and noticed an identical "W-Y".

The man, curious and angry, stood tall and said "what the fuck man, did you date Wendy too?" The black man sees him looking at his tattoo, and says "oh no man, I don't know her."

"Well what does your cock say?

 Now taking the frog from his pocket and placing it on the bar. Puzzled but intrigued the bartender fills his request. 

Time passes and people are glancing at him. Eventually an attractive blonde approaches him and says,

"WOW, your frog drinks beer? That's kinda amazing! What else does he do?"

The man looks around nervously, leans in and replies quietly,

"Well between me and you, the weirdest thing he likes to do is eat pussy."

The woman scoffs and goes back to drinking with her group. 

Time passes and it's close to bar closing. The blonde is visibly intoxicated and still intrigued by the frog. She reapproches the man and drunkenly says,

"I'm going to call your bluff. I don't think your frog knows how to eat pussy."

So they go back to her place, she undresses and kicks her leg up on the coffee table and he places the frog in front of her. 

The frog is just sitting there. The woman quips,

"See I told you..."

The man replies with a look of anticipation on his face,

"No, no, just give him a minute to warm up."

Minutes pass and the woman has become frustrated.

"He's not going to, I knew he wouldn't." She said to him.

"Well I guess you're right." Said the man in a defeated tone. 

Finally the man picks up the frog and says,

"I'm only going to show you how to do this one more time."

The Parrot and the Magician
The captain of a cruise ship had a parrot. The magician hated the parrot with intensity. Every time he would do a show, the captain would come watch, along with his bird. Eventually after watching enough shows the parrot started to learn the routines and the tricks behind them.

"The lady is under the box! The lady is under the box!"

"The rabbit is under the hat! The rabbit is under the hat!"

"There are two coins in the cup! There are two coins in the cup!"

This went on for 2 weeks, and the magician was finally fed up and about to quit, so he went to do his final show.

Right when the magician went up on stage, the boat crashed into an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the ocean. Everyone was dead. Everyone... except the magician... and as he floated on a plank of wood a bird flew and landed on the plank. The magician looked up and saw the parrot.

The magician stared at the parrot. The parrot stared at the magician. For 20 minutes they just stared hard at each other. Until finally the parrot said,

"I give up. I give up. Where the fuck is the ship."

A trucker is driving his regular route from St Louis to New Orleans
He’s passing through Arkansas and it’s raining buckets outside. The trucker pulls over at a small gas station in the middle of nowhere, deciding to take a short break and wait for the rain to pass. He heads inside and is greeted by the store clerk. The clerk is a dirty looking man in his mid fifties wearing tattered jeans and a stained T-shirt. 

“Boy, it sure is coming down out there. Would you happen to know if the rain’s supposed to let up anytime soon?” asks the trucker. The store clerk pauses, then proceeds to shove his hand down the back of his jeans and stick his index finger up his ass. He swirls it around for a moment before pulling it out and popping it in his mouth. 

The trucker is frozen in shock as the clerk stands there sucking on his finger with a furrowed brow, as if deep in thought. Finally, he takes his finger out of his mouth and replies loudly in a thick country accent, “Half an hour! Sun’s gon’ come out in bout half an hour.”

The trucker, still shocked, takes a seat in the corner and decides to wait and see if the clerk is correct. Sure enough, 30 minutes later the rain stops and the sun starts shining through the clouds. The trucker approaches the clerk again “That was incredible, how could you tell that the rain would stop?” The clerk smiles and says “I checked the weather this morning”.

This one time I was watching them both as they were walking really fast towards our home and stopped at our gate because she had some stuff in her hands. I saw the sons face he was very confused because everytime they came they never stopped for a second she, lifted her son and they entered the home. 

It felt like he was thinking "whenever I come in front of this gate I always get uplifted automatically and enter the gate" and was waiting to get lifted.

The stud rooster at a poultry farm is getting old, so the farmer buys a new one.

Once he's arrived, the new rooster walks up to the old one and says,"Listen here, Gramps! This whole farm is mine now!"

The old rooster says, "C'mon buddy? At least let me stick around with the old hens? We'll stay in the back?"

The new rooster is adamant "No way! All the hens are mine!".

The old rooster sighs, and offers a proposition: that the two of them race around the farmhouse and if the old rooster wins he can stay on the farm, if he loses then he'll leave and let the new rooster take over.

The only catch is that since the old rooster isn't in very good shape, he needs a head start.

So the roosters line up, the old one has his head start, and the new rooster takes off.

As he comes round the front of the house, the old rooster is just in front of him. He is so close to beating him. He stretches out his neck and leaps forward, desperate to close the gap between them.

That's when the farmer looks up from the front porch and sees the two roosters; he takes out his gun, shoots the new rooster in the head, and says,

"Damn! Third gay rooster this week!"

Dog For Sale

A guy is driving around the back woods of Montana and he sees a sign in front of a broken down shanty-style house:



'Talking Dog For Sale'. He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.


The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking

Labrador retriever sitting there.


You talk?' he asks. 



'Yep,' the Lab replies. 



After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says 'So, what's your story?' 

The Lab looks up and says, 'Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was

pretty young..I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA.

In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.' 

I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running.....but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.'



'I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.' 



The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.  Ten dollars,' the guy says.



Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?' 



Because he's a liar. He's never been out of the yard'.

pm . 
You can start tomorrow at 10:00 am , and plan on starting at 10:00 am
every day." 

The guy is puzzled and asks, "If the work hours are from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm , 
why don't you want me here until 10:00 am ?" 

"This is a government job", the interviewer says. "For the first two hours,

The guy seemed pretty convinced as it was a logical approach, with little else to lose, he decides to fly back home and try the remedy.  


He hops to his local deli, buys a fresh watermelon and heads home.  


He cuts the melon in half, drops his undergarments and squats over it, the scout worm comes out  looks at the fresh fruit, and crawls back in, " the queen must see this" the worm exclaims, the queen soon comes out, looks at the watermelon and exclaims " Alright bois! Bring it UP!"

A Mexican is strolling down the street in Mexico City and kicks a bottle lying in the street.

Suddenly out of the bottle comes a Genie. The Mexican is stunned and
the Genie says, "Hello master, I will grant you one wish; anything
you want."

The Mexican begins thinking, "Well, I really like drinking tequila."
Finally the Mexican says, "I wish to drink tequila whenever I want,
so make me pee tequila."

The Genie grants him his wish.

When the Mexican gets home, he gets a glass out of the cupboard and
pees in it. He looks at the glass and it's clear. Looks like tequila.
Then he smells the liquid. Smells like tequila. So he takes a taste
and it is the best tequila he has ever tasted.

The Mexican yells to his wife, "Consuelo, Consuelo, come quickly!"
She comes running down the hall and the Mexican takes another glass
out of the cupboard and fills it. He tells her to drink it. It is
tequila.

Consuelo is reluctant but goes ahead and takes a sip. It is the best
tequila she has ever tasted. The two drank and partied all night.

The next night the Mexican comes home from work and tells his wife to
get two glasses out of the cupboard. He proceeds to fill the two
glasses. The result is the same. The tequila is excellent and the
couple drinks until the sun comes up.

Finally Friday night comes and the Mexican comes home and tells his
wife, "Consuelo, grab one glass from the cupboard and we will drink
Tequila."

His wife gets the glass from the cupboard and sets it on the table.

The Mexican begins to fill the glass; and when he fills it, his wife
asks him, "But Pancho, why do we need only one glass?"

THE NUN AND THE HIPPIE

A hippie gets on a bus and spies a pretty young nun. He sits down next to her, and asks her: "Can we have sex?"



"No," she replies, "I'm married to God." She stands up, and gets off at the next stop.

The bus driver, who overheard, turns to the hippie and says: "I can tell you how to get to have sex with her!"

"Yeah?", says the hippie.

"Yeah!", say the bus driver. "She goes to the cemetery every Tuesday night at midnight to pray, so all you have to do is dress up in a robe with a hood, put some of that luminous powder stuff in your beard, and pop up in the cemetery claiming to be God."

The hippie decides to give it a try, and arrives in the cemetery dressed as suggested on the next Tuesday night. "I am God," he declares to the nun, keeping the hood low about his face. Have sex with me."

The nun agrees without question, but begs him to restrict himself to anal sex as she is desperate not to lose her virginity.

'God' agrees, and promptly has his wicked way with her. As he finishes, he jumps up, throws back his hood with a flourish and cries "Ha-ha, I'm the hippie!"

"Ha-ha," cries the nun. "I'm the bus driver!"

A difficult marriage.
A husband and wife were having marital struggles due to constant disagreements and an imbalance in responsibilities. The husband would come home from work and yell at his wife for not having dinner ready. The wife would yell at the husband for ignoring all the cleaning she's done when he tracked his muddy shoes in. They never tried to make each other happy anymore; it was just too much effort, and they were both tired. 

They tried counseling and therapy, and they were given many things to try. They set aside one night a week for date night, but they could never agree what to eat or what movie to watch. They made a list of chores, but could never agree who should be responsible for which chores. They tried to spend time with friends, but could never agree who's friends they would visit. 

Eventually the husband starting drinking. He would spend each night after work going to bars just so he wouldn't have to face going home. The wife started spending more time online chatting with strangers and fantasizing about meetups. The times they did spend together were filled with yelling and arguing. 

The husband starting carrying a flask with him wherever he went. He would wake up and immediately start drinking, and he wouldn't stop until he passed out at night. He could hardly remember what it felt like to be sober. 

The wife move from conversations online to coffee dates to motel infidelities. She never felt so alive as she did when driving to have sex with a stranger, and she never felt so worthless and dead inside as she did on the drive home. 

The husband and wife decided enough was enough. They would get divorced before the relationship became violent. They spent months fighting each other and arguing about who would get each little thing they owned. They brought in lawyers to fight for custody over simple things like the tennis rackets and the silverware set. They argued until the last minute before they turned in the paperwork the day before their court date. 

That day was just like all the others. The husband woke up, still a little drunk from the night before, and hit the bottle before speaking a word. The wife dolled herself up in the hopes she may meet a mysterious stranger at the courthouse and feel something other than sorrow. They got in the car and set out. 

The husband had barely pulled the car out of the driveway when the arguments started. He was drunk, but refused to let his wife drive. She hated his driving and wanted to listen to her music. It wasn't long before his anger got the best of him and he started driving erratically. He slammed on the gas and swerved around a corner. Their car smashed into a parked Honda. The airbags deployed as smoke billowed out of the engine. The car caught fire, and the husband and wife struggled to free themselves from the wreckage. The owner of the Honda arrived just in time to pull the couple from the burning car. 

Having been through a near death experience, the couple began to apologize for the first time in years through streaming tears and muffled sobs. The husband would stop drinking and help with the dishes. The wife would spend less time focused on herself and more time supporting her husband and the stress of his job. They were both sorry for the things they had done to each other. They decided they would work together, support each other, and try to make the relationship work. 

Two weeks later, the husband and wife were having lunch with their mutual friends. They were sober, honest, happy, in love, and most of all they were not arguing. Their friends noticed the clear difference in the relationship and said, "Wow! It seems like you guys are doing so much better!"

The husband smiled at his wife and looked to their friends. He took a deep breath and said, "Our lives are changed, and we couldn't be happier, and it's all because we finally struck an Accord."

A guy walked into the local welfare office to pick up his check.

He marched straight up to the counter and said, "Hi.. You know...., I just
HATE drawing welfare. I'd really rather have a job."

The social worker behind the counter said, "Your timing is excellent. We
just got a job opening from a very wealthy old man who wants a Chauffeur and
bodyguard for his beautiful daughter. You'll have to drive around in his
2019 Mercedes-Benz CL, and he will supply all of your clothes.

"Because of the long hours, meals will be provided. You'll also be expected
to escort the daughter on her overseas holiday trips. This is rather awkward
to say but you will also have as part of your job assignment to satisfy her
sexual urges as the daughter is in her mid-20's and has a rather strong sex
drive."

When out of nowhere, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by 30 of the most fierce-looking tribesmen, all with long spears, bows and arrows, as what looks like the chief walks right up to him.
The guy looks at his situation...and he cries out, "Oh god I'm so fucked!"Just then, the clouds above opened, and a bright light shined down upon him..and he heard a great, thunderous, but calm voice, and he said, "No, my son..you are NOT fucked. Pick up the large rock at your feet, and strike the man in front of you with all your might".The young man doesn't hesitate. He reaches down, picks up the rock, draws back and hits the chief right in the head.The chief just falls backwards, dead. Plop.The tribesmen all look at the chief, and then look at the young man, with a total look of stunned disbelief.Then the voice from above speaks again.."*NOW* you're fucked".

A monkey and a cue ball
 A guy walked into a bar with a monkey.  
The monkey grabbed some olives off the  
bar and ate them. Then he grabbed some  
sliced limes and ate them.  
He then jumped onto the pool table and  
grabbed one of the balls. To everyone's  
amazement, he stuck it in his mouth and  
somehow swallowed it whole.  
The bartender looked at the guy and  
said, "Did you see what your monkey  
just did?"  
"No, what?"  
"He just ate the cue ball off my pool  
table - whole!"  
"Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied  
the guy, "he eats everything in sight, don't  
worry, I'll pay for the cue ball."  
The guy finished his drink, paid his bill,  
paid for the stuff the monkey ate and  
left.  
Two weeks later the guy came back and  
had his monkey with him. He ordered a  
drink and the monkey started running  
around the bar. The monkey found a  
maraschino cherry on the bar. He  
grabbed it, stuck it up his butt, pulled it  
out and then ate it.  
Then the monkey found a peanut and  
again stuck it up his butt, pulled it out  
and ate it.  
The bartender asked, "Did you see what  
that filthy ape just did?"  
"No, what?" asked the man.  
"Well, he stuck both a maraschino cherry  
and a peanut up his arse, then he pulled  
them out and ate them."  
"Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied  
the guy. "He'll eat anything, but ever  
since he had to shit out that cue ball, he  
measures everything first."

Two guys from Michigan die and wake up in hell.
Two guys from Michigan die and wake up in hell. The next day, the devil stops to check on them and sees them dressed in parkas, mittens and bomber hats, warming themselves around the fire.
The devil asks them, "What are you doing? Isn't it hot enough for you?"

The two guys reply, "Well, you know, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know."

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats.
The devil asks them again, "It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?"

Again, the guys reply, "Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know."

The devil gets a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Michigan and finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling sausage and drinking beer. The devil is astonished. "Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves."

The two Michiganders reply, "Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Michigan, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice."

The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.

The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth.
The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 Michiganders. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering.
The devil was dumbfounded. "I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy. What is wrong with you two?"

The Michiganders look at the devil in surprise. "Well, don't ya know - if hell froze over, that must mean. The Lions won the Super Bowl!"

Moscow, 1970's. Freezing winter. The local butchershop is about to receive a new shipment of meat.
The day before, large crowd starts gathering in front of the butchershop. People are equipped with hot tea, warm coats and peacefully start forming a queue. 

After a few hours, the butcher steps outside and says: "Unfortunately, we won't be getting enough meat for everyone! The jews must go home!"

The jews orderly pack their things and head home.

A couple more hours pass and the butcher steps out again and says: "Unfortunately, we won't be getting any meat at all! Everyone must go home!"

The dissapointed mass of people slowly starts dispersing and a lone utterance can be heard from the crowd:

"Goddamn jews, they got lucky again!"

The guardsman, the commissar, and the orks.
Preface: In case you are not familiar with the Warhammer universe, if enough orks believe something, reality will warp to make it so. And no... I am not the author of the joke... Do get over it please.



Once upon a time, there was a fierce battle raging in the jungle between the Imperial Guard, and the local ork warband. Eventually, they were running so low on supplies that everyone only had the ammo on their person left. Gathering his courage, one of the guardsmen floated the idea of a tactical advance towards the home base to their commissar.

"Sir, at this rate, we will have no ammo left in an hour."

"Don't be ridiculous, soldier! All you need is your faith in the Emperor."

The commissar looked at him disapprovingly, raised his pistol at a charging ork, and yanked it up while shouting BANG! To everyone's surprise, the ork fell to the ground, unmoving. 

Emboldened, the soldiers started imitating him as they ran out of ammo, and the orks kept falling. Eventually they were really getting into it, even tossing rocks as grenades, and the battle was soon turning in their favour. Suddenly though, the orks broke through the "fire" and trampled the guardsmen. Before he lost consciousness, the last thing he heard, was the orks' chanting.

Area 51
You've all heard of the Air Force's ultra-high-security, super-secret  base in Nevada, known simply as "Area 51?" 

  Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were  very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their "secret" base. They  immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an  interrogation room. 

  The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and  spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel.  The Air  Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him  overnight during the investigation. 

  By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really  was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a  terrifying "you-did-not-see-a-base" briefing, complete with threats  of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was  that-a-way on such and such a heading, and sent him on his way. 

  The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same  Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the  plane...only this time there were two people in the plane. 

  The same pilot jumped out and said, "Do anything you want to me, but  my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last  night!"

Three men are captured by natives
A Frenchman, an Englishman, and a New Yorker were captured by a fierce tribe in a distant jungle. The chief comes to them and says, "The bad news is that now that we've caught you, we're going to kill you, and then use your skins to build a canoe. The good news is that you get to choose how you die." 

 The Frenchman says, "I take ze poison." The chief gives him some  poison. The Frenchman cries, "Vive la France!", quaffs the poison, and dies. 

 The Englishman says, "A pistol for me, please." The chief gives him a pistol. The Englishman points it at his head, says, "God save the queen!" and blows his brains out. 

 The New Yorker says, "Gimme a fork." The chief is puzzled, but he  shrugs and gives him a fork. The New Yorker takes the fork and starts jabbing himself all over the stomach, the sides, the chest -- everywhere. There's blood gushing out all over, it's horrible. The chief is appalled, and screams, "What are you doing?!" 

 The New Yorker looks at the chief and says, "So much for your canoe, ya jerk!"

Rudolf the Red
Actual joke I heard on my date yesterday:

So a couple was walking down the streets of Russia, when it began to precipitate. 

The man looked at the woman and said, "Its snowing!" And the woman promptly replied, "No dear, it's raining."

They went on arguing back and forth until they came upon a KGB Officer named Rudolf. 

They asked him, "Comrade, can you solve this problem for us, tell us please, is it snowing or raining?" 

Rudolf pondered this a moment and replied, "It is raining of course."

Joyous in her triumph, the woman looked at the man and said "see! Rudolf the Red knows rain dear!"

When Jane first met Tarzan in the jungle, she was instantly attracted to him and during her questions about his life, she asked him if he had ever had sex. 

"Tarzan not know sex." he replied.

Jane explained to him what it was. 

Tarzan said, "Ohhh...Tarzan use knot hole in trunk of tree."

Horrified, Jane said, "Tarzan, you have it all wrong, but I will show you how to do it  properly." 

She took off her clothing and lay down on the ground. 

"Here." she said, pointing to her privates, "You must put it in here." 

Tarzan removed his loin cloth, showing Jane his considerable manhood, stepped closer to her and kicked her right in the crotch!  

Jane rolled around in agony for what seemed like an eternity.  

Eventually, she managed to gasp for air and screamed, "What did you do that for?!"

Tarzan replied, "Check for squirrel."

An elderly couple, who were both widowed, had been going out with each other for a long time. Urged on by their friends, they decided it was finally time to get married. Before the wedding, they went out to dinner and had a long conversation regarding how their marriage might work. They discussed finances, living arrangements and so on.


Finally, the old gentleman decided it was time to broach the subject of their physical relationship. "How do you feel about sex?" he asked, rather tentatively.

"I would like it infrequently," she replied.

A well-traveled man goes to a strip club
When he gets a lap dance from one of the strippers, he asks if she is Chilean

‘Yes, I am!’ she says ‘How did you know?’

‘Well’ says the man ‘Much like Chile, you are tall and slim’

He later gets a lap dance from another stripper, and asks if she is Swiss

‘Yes, I am!’ she says ‘How did you know?’

‘Well’ says the man ‘Much like Switzerland, you have some rather large mountains’

He later gets a lap dance from another stripper, and asks if she is Finnish

‘Yes, I am’ she says ‘Do my blonde hair and green eyes make it obvious?’

‘No’ says the man ‘It’s your forest in the south’

A man goes to the doctors office for a check up with his wife once every 10 years
Every time he goes his wife sits in with him to make sure he listens to the doctor’s advice.

When the man is 30 the doctor comes in and asks him, do you drink, smoke or have sex? The man replies, “almost every day.” The doctor tells him to cut down on smoking or he’ll die of lung disease by 40. The embarrassed wife says “He’s not a chain smoker but I’ll make sure he cuts back”

When he’s 40, the same doctor comes in and asks again, do you drink, smoke, or have sex? The man replies, I’ve cut down on smoking like you said, but i drink and have sex almost every day still. The doctor says to cut out drinking or his liver will fail by 50. The wife embarrassed again says “He’s not an alcoholic but I’ll make sure he slows down”

When he’s 50 they go back to the same doctor, and he asks him again, do you drink, smoke or have sex? The man replies I cut out smoking and drinking like you said but I still have sex almost every day. The doctor says to cut out sex or his heart will fail by 60. The embarrassed wife again says “He’s not a sex addict, I’ll make sure he takes it easier.”

When he’s 60 the man goes back, but shows up without his wife. The same doctor asked what happened to her. The man replies “She is too old and can’t follow him around anymore.” The doctor asks the man again do you drink, smoke or have sex?

The man replies, I drink and smoke everyday since my wife can’t stop me anymore, but even with my wife so old we still have sex almost everyday. The doctor, curious now, asks how he can still keep up with the sex. The man replies, “Oh it’s very easy. We have sex almost on Monday, almost on Tuesday, almost on Wednesday”

Covoid-19 walks into a bar.
Bartender says we're closed.

A man walks into an unfamiliar bar
He sits down at the bar and sees a pot of cash filled to the brim with notes. As he orders his drink he ask the bartender "what's with the pot of cash?"

The barman replies "we have a 3 tier game going on, winner takes all. £100 entry."

"Just out of curiosity, whats involved?" Asks the stranger.

"Well, first part is, you see the bouncer there? You have to knock him out in one punch. Second part, well we have this rottweiler out back with a dodgy tooth, it needs pulling, but that dog's too vicious for anyone to get close to."

"And the third part?" Enquires the stranger.

"Ah, well, the landlady of this establishment here, she lost her husband a fair few years ago, and has since become a bit of a recluse. Third part is you have to go upstairs, and give her a good old rogering."

The stranger looks at his drink and says "that's ridiculous, you'd have to be bonkers to play".

By pint 7, looking at the pot of cash, the stranger pulls out £100, slams it into the pot, rushes over to the bouncer, and with a clean strike, sends the bouncer flying to the floor unconscious. He makes his way out back with a determined look.

The rest of the bar have seen stage one and excitedly rush to the back door where all they here are barks and thrashing, then followed by yelps and silence. The stranger kicks open the back door, clothes shredded and covered in blood and shouts "Right! Where's this landlady with a dodgy tooth!?"

Anniversary
Their three kids, all very successful, agreed to a Sunday dinner in their
honor.



"Happy Anniversary Mom and Dad," gushed son number one ....'Sorry I'm
running late. I had an emergency at the hospital with a patient, you know
how it is, and I didn't have time to get you a gift."



"Not to worry," said the father. 

"The important thing is that we're all together today."



Son number two arrived and announced, "You and Mom look great, Dad.

I just flew in from Los Angeles between depositions and didn't have time to
shop for you."



"It's nothing," said the father. "We're glad you were able to come."



Just then, the daughter arrived. "Hello and happy anniversary! I'm sorry,
but my boss is sending me out of town and I was really busy packing so I
didn't have time to get you anything.."



After they had finished dessert, the father said, "There's something your
mother and I have wanted to tell you for a long time. You see, we were very
poor. Despite this, we were able to send each of you to college. 



Throughout the years your mother and I knew that we loved each other very
much, but we just never found the time to get married."



The three children gasped and all said, "You mean we're bastards?"



"Yep," said the father. "And cheap ones too."

I asked the woman I was sitting next to on the train, "if I could smell her feet?"
She looked at me crazy and said, "NO! That's Gross!" 

So I said, "Ah must be your pussy then."

Sister

At the cemetery
At the cemetery, the Gravedigger digs quietly and puffs from his cigarette from time to time.

From a nearby grave, a hand pops out and soon the other hand emerges too. The Gravedigger, minding his own business, keeps on digging and smoking peacefully.

Not after long the dead rises completely, rotten flesh all over and with a hideous grimace on his face. The Gravedigger keeps on digging and smoking peacefully.

The dead rushes at him, screaming, and tries to scare the Gravedigger but he barely gives a look at the creature and keeps on digging and smoking peacefully.

Seeing there\`s no way to scare the Gravedigger, the dead heads for the cemetery wall and tries to jump over.

Suddenly a shovel hits the nape of the dead so hard he falls down in shock.

The Gravedigger: "We joke, we laugh, but we don\`t leave the premises".

A man goes to a brothel.
The madam opened the brothel door in Winnipeg and saw a rather dignified, well-dressed, good-looking man in his late forties or early fifties.
 
 
 
 
"May I help you sir?" she asked.
 
 
 
 
The man replied,
 
 
"I wan to see Valerie."
 
 
 
 
"Sir, Valerie is one of our most expensive ladies.
 
Perhaps you would prefer someone else" said the madam.
 
 
 
 
He replied,
 
 
"No, I must see Valerie."
 
 
 
 
Just then, Valerie appeared and announced to the man she charged $5000 a visit.
 
 
 
 
Without hesitation, the man pulled out five thousand dollars and gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs.
 
After an hour, the man calmly left.
 
 
 
 
The next night, the man appeared again, once more demanding to see Valerie.
 
 
Valerie explained that no one had ever come back
 
two nights in a row as she was too expensive.
 
 
"There are no discounts. The price is still $5000."
 
Again, the man pulled out the money, gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs.
 
 
 
 
After an hour, he left.
 
 
 
 
The following night the man was there yet again.
 
 
 
 
Everyone was astounded that he had come for a third consecutive night, but he paid Valerie and they went upstairs.
 
 
 
 
After their session, Valerie said to the man,
 
 
"No one has ever been with me three nights in a row."
 
"Where are you from?"
 
 
 
 
The man replied,
 
 
" New Brunswick ."
 
"Really," she said. "I have family in New Brunswick ."
 
 
 
 
"I know." the man said.
 
 
"Your sister died, and I am her attorney."

Coronavirus Pandemic Day 17
If anyone is still out there, I’m alive but struggling. Food is running low. Down to only 459 days worth. My hands are super sanitized and my butt is super clean. Down to 1599 rounds of ammo (dropped 1 round down the heat vent while doing daily inventory). Power still on, but for how long? Missing human interaction but I have my dogs.. for now.. (I'm soaking their food in BBQ sauce in an attempt to marinate them from the inside in case I have to eat them) . I fear dark days ahead. News is all bad. Neighbors have attempted to leap from windows to their death, (or near death... most have single story homes so they are badly bruised). Blew through most Netflix series so may have to rewatch some again..Basic Survival is a definite challenge. I vow to persevere to the end, I am a survivor! Please, if there is life out there, communicate with me to help preserve my sanity..

Out pops a genie...
A guy is walking along the beach one day and stubs his toe. He looks down to see what he hit, and it was a bottle. He opens it up and out pops a genie. “I’ve been in here 10,000 years and for releasing me, I’m going to grant you 3 wishes! However, there is a catch. Whatever you wish for, your ex-wife gets double.”

Guy- Man, I hate my ex-wife... Well, she left me homeless when she left. I’ve had to crash with friends, but I’d like a new house.

Genie- Done! You have an enormous mansion on top of the mountain overlooking the ocean. Your ex-wife has 2 new houses.

Guy- Damn! Well, between what she took and the legal fees, I’m broke and struggling to make ends meet. I wish I had a million dollars.

Genie- Done! You have a million dollars in your bank account. Your ex-wife has 2 million dollars. 

Guy- Shit! I HATE my ex-wife!

Genie- For your last wish?

Guy- *Thinking for a moment* Beat me half to death!

I was having a beer at the bar when a mate walks in, panicked
He sits down next to me and tells me he’s left his sidekick in the car, because she drives him absolutely mad and he really needed a break.

I chuckled at his irresponsible behavior before he tells me “I told her I’d be back in a few minutes, but all lights in my car are broken anyway, can’t you go keep her busy for a little while?” 

Me, having a few beers down already, agreed and before I knew it she’s on top of me in the backseat. 

A few minutes later a cop starts knocking on the window, frustrated, shining a light into the car and telling us to calm down.

“Don’t worry, it’s my wife” I say

His wife was standing there at the bench watching him. After a long period of silence she finally speaks. "Honey, I've just been thinking, now that we are married maybe it's time you quit spending all your time out here in the garage and you probably should just consider selling all your cars.

Tom gets this horrified look on his face. She says, "Darling, what's wrong?" 

"There for a minute you were starting to sound like my ex-wife." 

"Ex-wife!”, she screams, "YOU NEVER TOLD ME  YOU WERE MARRIED BEFORE!!!!!!!"

A lion tamer had quit without notice and the circus manager needed someone to replace him for the next night's show.
He out an ad in the local paper and the next morning two applicants showed up outside his office. One was a rather ordinary looking young man and the other was a rather ravishing red headed beauty. Neither one of them looked very much like a lion trainer, but the manager was desperate.

"All right" he said, "here's a whip, a chair and a gun. Let's see what you can do with big Leo over there. We'll let you have the first try, miss, but be careful- he's a mean one."

The ravishing redhead strode past the whip, the chair and the gun, and empty handed, fearlessly entered the cage.

Big Leo, snarling, then came charging across the cage towards her with a ferocious road. When the lion was almost upon her, the girl threw open her coat. Underneath she was stark naked. Leo skidded to a stop and crawled the rest of the way on his belly; he nuzzled the girl's feet with his nose, purred and licked her trim ankles.

The astonished circus manager grinned happily and turned to the pop-eyed young man. "Well, young fella," he asked, "think you can top THAT? "

"Yeah ?" panted the applicant, "Just get that stupid lion out of there,"

Dark comedy is like clean water.
Not everyone gets it.

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...
If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

Golden Wedding Secret
A husband and wife were coming up on their 50th wedding anniversary, and the wife had grown curious about a box under their bed. It had a lock on it, and had been present ever since she married him. On the night of their golden wedding anniversary, the wife decided it was time she found out what was inside it.

Wife: "Dear, we've been married for 50 years now, and all this time you've kept this locked box under our bed. I think it's about time you told me what was inside it."

Husband: "Alright, but you have to promise you won't get angry."

Wife: "We've been married 50 years now, when have you known me to get angry?"

So the husband took out a key and brought the box out from under the bed. He opened the box and revealed three eggs and  a massive stack of bank notes.

Wife: "Look at all that money! What are those three eggs for?"

Husband: "Well, on the night of our wedding I made a decision that every time I was unfaithful to you during our marriage I would buy an egg and place it inside this box."

Wife: "In 50 years you've only been unfaithful three times. That's not bad. What about the money?"

Husband: "Every time I got a dozen eggs, I sold them."

So a bloke goes to the doctor, complaining his dick keeps dribbling after he finishes pissing
After a brief examination, the doctors announces he has a solution.

"Hold still while I pluck one of your nose hairs", he says. 

The man thinks it's weird, but if it will stop his dick dribbling, he'll do anything.

"Now, I'm just going to graft this nose hair onto the end of your penis. It's a new procedure they say works very well".

The doctor applies applies a local anaesthetic and quickly completes the procedure. The man, somewhat bewildered asks, "how is this supposed to work? This is crazy".

The doctor smiles and tells him to try out the new appendage, pointing the man to the toilet.

"This is bullshit", thinks the man. So he goes to the toilet and has a nice, long piss. "Here we go, it's just gonna keep dribbling", he thinks. 

Sure enough, he shakes off the last drop and instantly he can feel it start to dribble - but just at that moment, his dick lets out a monumental....

Do You Like Pussycats?
  


Sarah, a recently widowed Jewish lady, was sitting on a beach towel at Cocoa Beach, Florida.  


She looked up and noticed that a man her age had walked up, placed his blanket on the sand nearby and began reading a book.  


Smiling, she attempted to strike up a conversation with him.  


"Hello, sir," how are you?  


"Fine, thank you," he responded, and turned back to his book.  


"I love the beach. Do you come here often?" she asked.  


"First time since my wife passed away last year," he replied, and again turned back to his book.  


"Do you live around here?" she asked.  


"Yes, I live over in Suntree, he answered, and then resumed reading.  


Trying to find a topic of common interest, Sarah persisted "Do you like pussycats?"  


With that, the man threw his book down, jumped off his blanket onto hers, tore off both their swimsuits and gave her the most passionate ride of her life!  


As the cloud of sand began to settle, Sarah gasped and asked the man, "How did you know that was what I wanted?"  


The man replied, "How did you know my name was Katz?"

Love is like corn dog
Bitches would only want my weiner if I got the bread

Two girls are speaking and one tearfully confesses:
\- Oh, Jane, I've a problem: I've never been eaten because my pussy smells a lot like onion.

\- I think you're in luck: I have a friend, Tony, who can't smell absolutely anything. And seeing how beautiful you are, I'm sure you will get along well.

The girl calls the boy, they meet to go for a walk, go to the movies, go to dinner ... an evening so perfect that they end up sharing a taxi to go home. When the taxi arrives at the girl's house, she mischievously tells the boy that if he wants to go up to his house to have a last drink, and the boy accepts. They have a glass of wine, another glass, one thing ends up leading to another and they go to bed. They turn off the lights and go with the preliminaries, kisses, caresses, and finally he ends up going down with great delight of the girl. But in a minute he stops and, sticking his head out from her legs, he says to the girl:

\- Hey, this smells a lot like onion, right?

\- How? My friend told me that you couldn't smell anything.

And the boy answers:

\- And I can't, but MY EYES ARE FUCKING WATERING!!!

A man and his wife visit Las Vegas for their 15th anniversary. Being the spontaneous couple they always have been the husband decides that their first night he will do all the planning.
They go out a fancy steak dinner and he pays extra to have the band sing their wedding song tableside and serenade his wife. She melts.

He then takes her to a magic show and pays extra to have her involved in the main act as the woman who disappears within the act.  She is beaming with joy.

She's loving every minute of it as they return to their hotel.  They check in and decide to go to the poker floor for some gambling before heading up to their room.  They play a few hands, win a little and the husband excuses himself to go the bathroom.

Unfortunately, a new, fairly naive employee is running the concierge desk and finds the woman by herself.  He mentions to her that the room is now ready and that Dumbo was already delivered.  Since she had no idea what he was talking about as the husband handled booking everything she just assumed it was some exciting surprise.

The husband comes back and she motions it's time to head up to bed with a suggesting wink.

As they get to their room, a massive sprawling suite, the husband tells her he has two more surprises for her.  There is a strange smell in the suite but it's beautiful and overlooks the strip. They head out to the balcony and on ice is their favorite wine from their honeymoon.  They start to loosen their clothing and really relax into the evening... it's getting quite steamy between the two.

The husband says, ok I have one more surprise, wait here.  Five minutes later, he calls out for her to come to the bathroom.  He's set the stage as he has lit candles and a warm bubble bath poured with smooth jazz playing in the background.  They begin to undress but suddenly there is a knock on the door.

The husband winks at his wife.  He goes to answer the door and tells her to get in the tub. 

The night of surprises continue as the husband walks back in with a naked man.  The wife gasps and is very confused.  The husband begins to tell her about some very surprising, erotic fantasies he has had about a threesome.  She continues to have a very confused look on her face.  Shes never had a night like this in all 15 years of her marriage.

Seeing that his wife isn't into this, he asks the man to give them a second.  He leans over to the tub and says, "Is everything ok?  I thought you would be into this.  Maybe I read this wrong but I thought I might like it too."

She stares at him and that loving gaze he saw earlier in the night turned into a glare.

Several awkward moments of silence pass and the suspense is upsetting to the husband.  He thinks to himself, "what was i thinking..." "does she think I am homosexual?" "Am I?" "Did I just screw up 15 perfect years of marriage??"

"Please say something!" He pleads.

She raises her arms in disbelief.

"Are we not going to talk about the elephant in the room?"

My dad has been missing for weeks now
So, a long time ago, my father went missing. I don't know where he went. I called the police, and they sent out a search team for him. A couple days later, they still haven't found him. Weeks, months, years, go by... Still no dad. "I can't believe I lost dad," I whisper to myself. "I'm sorry, dad..."

 All of a sudden, I hear something behind me. I was home alone at the time so I went straight to the assumption that someone was in here when they shouldn't be. I look around my house, nobody. But, then, I feel something touch my shoulder. I shiver. And I hear a familiar voice. It says... "Hi, sorry. I'm dad."

A man dies and surprise! he finds himself in the sky and surrounded by clouds and in front of an old  man who asks, ”Heaven or Hell?”  

Guy goes, "what kind of question is that?"  and  the old man sighs and goes, “oh another one.  Well allow me to show you and then you can make your decision from there”.  

So  the old man shows him Hell and everybody's gambling and drinking and drugging and whoring and playing heavy metal music and having the time of their life it seems.   “Pretty sweet!” the guy goes,  but the old man goes "okay now let's show you Heaven,"  and he's whisked away and he shows him a scene  in the clouds  where everybody's meditating and doing yoga thinking and reading and doing good works and playing the harp and... 

And then the old man then goes, “ well what'll It Be Heaven or Hell?”  And  the guy goes, "That's the no-brainer of a lifetime, Hell please!”  so the old man obliges and he's immediatly whisked him to Hell where he was cast into a pit of sulfur and a thousand demons torment him non-stop and in between the third demon and the fouth demon boning him up the ass with a hedge trimmer the guy screams in agony "What the actual fuck !! This is not  what I was promised this is not what I was shown!!!! " and one of the demons who was watching goes , “oh you saw the demo version".

The poor man nods. Then the rich man asks him, "So what are you getting your wife this year?" The poor man thinks about it for a second and replies, "A pair of slippers and a dildo."

The rich man asks, "Why those two things?" The poor man astutely reponds, "This way, if she doesn't like the slippers she can go f*ck herself.”

"But you said it only said it costs 5,000" said the man confused

"You misheard sir, I said it *starts* at 5,000 every thing costs extra" replied the employee "let me explain the pricing for you, you can get either our aluminum suspension for 7,500, our steal suspension for 15,000, or our premium carbon fiber suspension for 35,000" said the employee

"well you did get all of the luxury's"

"And what were they, you what I don't care, how do I pay"

"Before you pay would you like to buy Apple Care to insure your car" the employee asks

"Fine, how much is it" he ask

"For the price you paid that will be 289,230 or 12,050.25 a month"

She quarantines herself, is given drugs to fight the virus and after 3 weeks, she is cleared to resume her normal life. In her intestines the 3 remaining virus cells are discussing where they are going to hide knowing death was imminent. The first cell says "I'm going to go to her inner ear, the drugs will never get me there". The second cell says "I'm going to hide at the tip of her toe, the drugs will never get me there". Finally, the last one says, "I'm going to go to her vagina and hide there". "Vagina" says one, why there? "Because, he said when that train pulls out at 5:15 tonight, I'm gonna be on it".

The Husband Store
A new store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City , where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

"That's nice," she thinks, "but I want more." So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

"Wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

"Oh, mercy me!" she exclaims, "I can hardly stand it!" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

PLEASE NOTE:

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.

$10 is $10
Joe and his wife Martha went to the annual show every year and each time Joe would say: “Martha, I’d like to ride in that plane.”

And every year Martha would reply: “I know Joe, but that plane ride costs $10, and $10 is $10.”

One year Joe and Martha went to the fair and he said: “Martha, I’m 71 years old. If I don’t ride that plane this year I may never get another chance.”

Martha replied: “Joe, that plane ride costs $10, and $10 is $10.”

The pilot overheard them and said: “Folks, I’ll make you a deal, I’ll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won’t charge you, but if you say one word it’s $10.” Joe and Martha agreed and up they went.

The pilot did all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word was heard. He did all his tricks over again, but still not a word. They landed and the pilot turned to Joe: “By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn’t.”

Joe replied: “Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but $10 is $10.”

"Donald, the Filipino people would be happy to do anything within their power to help you," replied Duterte. "I do need your help," said Donald. "Could you possibly send 100,000,000 condoms ASAP to tide us over?"

"Why certainly! I'll get right on it!" said Duterte. "Oh, and one more small favor, please?" said Donald.

"Yes?" said Duterte.

Showing off, Donald said, "Could the condoms be red, white, and blue in color and at least 10" long and 4" in diameter?"

"No problem," replied Duterte, with that, Duterte hung up and called the owner of Philippine Prophilactic. "I need a favor, you've got to make 100,000,000 condoms right away and send them to the White House." "Consider it done Mr. President," said the owner of Philippine Prophilactics. "Great! Now listen, they have to be red, white and blue in color, 10" long and 4" wide." "Easily done. Anything else?"

"Yeah," said Duterte, "on each one, print 'MADE IN THE PHILIPPINES, SIZE-SMALL' ."

A lawyer married a woman who had previously divorced ten husbands.

On their wedding night, she told her new husband, "Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin."

"What?" said the puzzled groom? "How can that be if you've been married ten times?"

"Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative: he kept telling me how great it was going to be.

Husband #2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.

Husband #3 was from field services: he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.

Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.

Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.

Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.

Husband #7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.

Husband #8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it. 

Husband #9 was a gynecologist: all he did was look at it.

Husband #10 was a stamp collector: all he ever did was... God! I miss him!

But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!"

"Good," said the new husband, "but, why?"

"You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed!"

In the near future the world is a wasteland consumed by the coronavirus...
Countries have collapsed into chaotic anarchist colonies, cities have been engulfed by greenery and animals, vital supplies are fought over like packs of wolves and a fighting couple plagued with exhaustion and starvation try to escape the apocalyptic horror. They suddenly catch sight of a man holding a toolbox with goggles on. He strangely looks very clean as if this pandemic never touched him in the slightest. "Hey! Who are you?! Can you help us?!" calls the couple. "Yes! I started this pandemic and I will end it!" he answers. "What?! You did?! Why did you fucking do this?! How do you expect to end this?!" the couple gasp, angrily. The man smiles and pulls out a black shiny object. "To show you the power of flex tape...I SAWED THIS WORLD IN HALF!"

Michael O’Leary, Chief Executive of Ryanair after arriving in a hotel in Manchester went to the bar and asked for a pint of Guinness.  

The barman said, "That will be £1 please, Mr. O’Leary." 

 Taken aback, O'Leary replied, "That's very cheap," and handed over his money.  

"We do try to stay ahead of the competition", said the barman. "We have the cheapest beer in England". 

 "That is remarkable value", Michael comments. 

 "I see you don't have a glass, you'll need one of ours. That will be £3 please.", the barman said

O'Leary scowled, but paid up. He took his drink and walked towards a seat.  

 "Ah, you want to sit down?" said the barman. "That'll be an extra £2. If you'd pre-booked it would have cost £1." 

O'Leary swore to himself, but paid up.  

 "I see you've brought your laptop" added the barman. "That wasn't pre-booked either, that's another £3." 

O'Leary was so incensed and his face was red with rage.  "I've had enough! I insist on speaking to a manager!"

  "Here is his e-mail address, or if you wish, you can contact him between 9.00 am and 9.01am every morning, Monday to Tuesday. Calls are free, unless answered, then there is a charge of only £1 per second".  

"I will never use this bar again".  "OK but do remember, we are the only hotel in England selling pints for £1."

When he got to the bank he was surprised to see that they had a new safety policy in place that required you to be naked to enter. So he stripped down and got in line to see a teller. 

It had been a little while for Bill, so seeing all these naked people was getting him aroused. 

After a few minutes in line Bill finally makes it to the teller, hands her the cash, and lets her know that he needs to pay his mortgage. 

“Sorry” says the teller, “but our policy doesn’t allow for us to accept hard bills.”

It’s 1 in the morning and a drunk bar patron decides it’s time to go home.
He gets up off his barstool and immediately faceplants.

“Oh, holy crap. I’m drunker than I thought!”

He pulls himself up with the barstool, lets go, and faceplants again.

“Shit!”

He crawls to the front door. He tries pulling himself up with the door knob and door frame. Once again, he lets go and drops straight to the ground.

“This is bullshit. I didn’t even have that much to drink!”

When he finally crawls to the sidewalk, he grabs hold of a light pole. Again, he pulls himself up, lets go, and immediately collapses.

“Shit, this is going to be a long crawl home!”

It’s a long, grueling trek, but he finally makes it home. By the time he reaches his front steps, the sky is a light pink and blue and birds are beginning to chirp.

As he reaches for the doorknob, it twists and the door swings wide open. He looks up to see his ever-so-livid wife glaring down at him.

A father walks into a bookstore with his young son. The boy is holding a quarter. Suddenly, the boy starts choking, going blue in the face. The father realizes the boy has swallowed the quarter and starts panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed, attractive and serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar reading a newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee. At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, neatly folds the newspaper and places it on the counter, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the book store.
Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants; takes hold of the boy's testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.
After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the quarter, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.
Releasing the boy's testicles, the woman hands the coin to the father and walks back to her seat in the coffee bar without saying a word.
As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, "I've never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?"
"No," the woman replied. "Divorce attorney"

Last night I hooked up with a girl I met at a club. She seemed nervous about going back to my place, so I told her a few jokes to help her relax.

Yesterday I was at my local TESCO’ store buying a large bag of Winalot dog food for my loyal pet and was in the checkout
queue when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog.

What did she think I had, an elephant? On impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Winalot Diet again. 

I added that I probably shouldn'’t, because I ended up in hospital last time, but I'd lost 2 stone before I woke up in intensive care with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.

I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with Winalot nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well
and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in queue was now enthralled with my story.)

Horrified, she asked me if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off the kerb to sniff an Irish Setter's arse and a car hit me.

I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard. 

I'm now banned from TESCO.

The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs.

When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, 'Who was that?'

My Gay Parrot! (Kinda crappy I know)
So my pet parrot and I have a tight bond. Like, super tight. He's basically my dude, my bro, the cock to my balls you might say. However, I have always made it clear to him that our relationship is far from romantic. Recently though, he began learning to put more complex phrases together and has been using sloppy one liners in an attempt to seduce me. He has always had an extremely potent sex drive, his name is "Busta" (if you catch my drift).

Have you ever been seduced by a parrot before? No?

Well, it is hella weird and kinda perverted given the squawky voice that parrots have. The attempts are very rudimentary and sloppy as a bj from a spider monkey, but there is definitely an attempt to sound natural and sexy. His favorite phrases vary from nonsense such as "Boy you tomato? Cuz Busta wanna hump" to a relatively sophisticated "Guess where I hide food pellets" or even "You. Me. Bang Bang!"

Now, it eventually came to the point that I could no longer simply ignore his advances. (Plus I was getting tired of being woken up to a bird dry humping my foot) Yesterday, I had a sit down with him, it played out something like this.

Me: "Yo, so umm... we gotta talk"

Busta: "You fuck me?"

Me: "NO! See, this is what we gotta talk about man. Listen, You are a damn sexy parrot bro, and any other bird would be lucky to have you. You are charming, confident, and very intelligent. But like bro, I'm not gay. I don't feel for you the same way. Plus I'm a person. My dick would literally destroy you!"

Busta: "Thats the fuckin idea" \*sexy parrot wink\*(you shoulda seen it. freaky as hell)

Me: "NO IT'S NOT!! DON'T YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING!?"

Busta \*looks at his birdie boner in shame\*

Me: "I DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK!"

She says, "How much for the black one?"

He says, "$15."

So she buys the black one.

A little bit later a black woman comes in and asks the salesman, "How much for the black dildo?"

"$15."

"And how much for the white one?"

"$10."

So she buys the white one.

"$35."

So she buys the plaid one.

About an hour later the guy's boss returns from lunch and asks, "How did you do while I was gone?"

And the salesman says, "For ten dollars I sold a black woman a white dildo. For fifteen dollars I sold a white woman a black dildo. And for thirty five dollars I sold a Polish woman a thermos."

"And I say, 'Take a shit on the ground!' And what can he do? I have a pistol, he don't have a pistol! So he take a shit on the ground."

Pete has a stutter though so he goes " h-he-hello guys would y-you you mind if i come f-f-fi-fishing with you?"
They look at eachother and decide that "yes you can come, but be quiet, we don't want you to scare away the fish". So pete all happy gets in the boat and they go out into the sea. 
All goes well, pete is having fun, the fishermen are getting fish, its like a dream come true. 
Suddenly behind them appears a huge ship, getting closer and closer.
The fishermen don't notice but Pete does and he goes "G-G-Guys" 
"SHHHH you'll scare the fish away"
"B-B-BUT THERE'S A SH-SH-SH.."

A husband and wife decide on a code language whenever they feel like having sex to escape the attention of their son.
 According to the code language, the wife will be the typewriter and the husband will act as the typist. 
However, they had a petty quarrel a few days ago and were not talking to each other. 

One day the husband gets into the mood and he can’t hold any longer. So he sends a word to his wife through the son. The son comes and tells her, “Mom, dad wants to use the typewriter.” 

The wife was having her period at that time and she thought for a while and said, “Tell dad, he can’t because the red ribbon is on now,” she said. However, the husband misunderstands that it was a deliberate excuse on her part. 

Next day the son comes to his dad on an errand from his mom this time and tells him, “Dad, mom said it is okay now; the red ribbon is removed and you can type.” The husband then tells his son, “Tell your mom I don’t need to type now. It was urgent, so I've already written with my hand!”

Wire brush and Dettol
HRH Anne, the Princess Royal, is visiting the regiment of which she is Colonel-in-Chief and goes on a tour of the base hospital. She sees a patient in one bed and goes over to him, and he turns red and tries to hide beneath the bedspread; but the Princess is having none of this and says to the RSM escorting her "What is this patient's ailment, sergeant-major?" -- "Haemorrhoids, ma'am!" says the RSM smartly.

She turns to the patient and says "Don't be embarrassed, you silly man: in equestrian circles we know all about this condition, trust me. What is the treatment?" -- "Wire brush and Dettol, ma'am!" says the sergeant-major.

"I see," says HRH, and to the patient in the bed: "And what is your ambition, soldier?" -- "To make a speedy recovery and return to the service of my Queen and country, ma'am!" says the soldier. "Very good, carry on," says the Princess.

The next patient turns a still deeper shade of crimson and lies there paralysed with embarrassment. "What is this patient's ailment?" HRH asks the RSM. -- "Syphilis, ma'am. Self-inflicted injury. No sympathy at all!"

"I see," says HRH. "Well, now, single men in barracks and all that, as Kipling says. No use judging the man harshly. And what is the treatment?" -- "Wire brush and Dettol, ma'am!" says the RSM.

"And what is your ambition, soldier?" -- "To make a speedy recovery and return to the service of my Queen and country, ma'am!" says the soldier. "Very good, carry on," says the Princess.

The third patient looks less embarrassed, and the Princess Royal addresses him directly, "And what is the matter with you, soldier?" -- "Tonsillitis, ma'am!" says the soldier.

"How very distressing," says the Princess. "And the treatment is..." --  "Wire brush and Dettol, ma'am!" says the RSM.

"And what is your ambition, soldier?" -- "To get to the wire brush and Dettol before those two dirty bastards, ma'am!" says the soldier.

Three couples are trying to get married at the same church.
There is a young couple, a middle-aged couple, and an elderly couple. The three couples meet with the priest and discuss when they can get married.
"If you wish to get married in my church, you must all go one month without having sex," says the priest.
One month later the three couples return to the church and talk to the priest. He then asks the elderly couple, "Have you completed the month with sex?"
"Yes we have, it was easy," replies the elderly couple.
"How about you?" He asks the middle-aged couple.
"It was hard, but we didn't have sex for the whole month," they respond.
"And how about you two?" He asks the young couple.
 "No we couldn't do it," responds the boyfriend.
 "Tell me why," says the priest.
"Well my girlfriend had a can of corn in her hand and she accidentally dropped it. She bent over to pick it up and that's when it happened."
The priest then tells them, "You're not welcome in my church."
"We're not welcome in the supermarket either," says the boyfriend

Bruce Lee's parrot
A woman seeking to buy a parrot entered a petshop. There she greeted the shopkeeper and asked for a reasonably priced parrot. The shopkeeper proceeded to show her every parrot that he got. The first parrot was blue and green and could speak every language. The woman was amazed by its skills but she didn't like its price so much. "5 thousand dollars are too much for what he does" she said. Eventually the woman did not find something that she liked, so she was ready to leave. The shopkeeper aware of her displeasure, told her to wait and went to the back, only to come back with a huge black bird, full of grey spots, sharp claws, a sliced eye and a crooked beak. The woman disgusted from the monstrosity that laid upon her, asked what kind of bird that was. The shopkeeper told her everything about the bird. How it was trained by Bruce Lee himself, the art o karate, Kung fu and a bunch of others. She was amazed, but again it was not enough for her to buy it. The shopkeeper told her to be patient. He organised a little representation of what the parrot could do. He took her to the back where many random furniture were scattered all over the place. The shopkeeper started by pointing a wooden chair and saying "chair karate" The menacing bird raised its wings, and within a split second, the chair was cut into million pieces. He then proceeded by pointing a big iron wardrobe and saying "wardrobe karate" The bird again raises its wings and destroys the wardrobe. The woman shocked, pulled out her purse and took out a good amount of cash, and she gave it to the shopkeeper. She took the parrot and started heading home. When she arrived she found her husband lying on the couch watching TV. He saw the bird with surprise and curiosity and asked her wife what was that abomination that sat on her shoulder, and why did she return home without a parrot that she said she got it. She answered that this is the parrot that she choose, and she also tried to convince him that it would be great as a bodyguard. Curious the man asks why. She told him how the bird knows karate, can destroy anything and defeat any burglar. The man laughed at her claims and said: 
"Pffft, karate my ass! "

The National Park Rangers are advising hikers in Glacier National Park and other Rocky Mountain parks to be alert for bears and take extra precautions to avoid an encounter.
They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.

Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.

It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat. Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper.

Principal: What is 3+3?

Boy: 6.

Principal: 6+6.

Boy: Bubble gum.

Madam: You stick your pole inside me. You tie me down to get me up, I get wet before you do.

Boy: Tent.

Madam: A finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you are bored. The best man always has me first?.

Boy: Wedding ring.

Madam: I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I drip. When you blow me, you feel good?

Boy: Nose.

Madam: I have a stiff shaft. My tip penetrates, I come with a quiver.

Boy: Arrow.

Principal: OH MY GOD.

Madam: What starts with 'F' and ends wit a 'K' and if you don't get it, you have to use your hand?

Boy: Fork.

The Prom
A high school senior is getting ready to take his girlfriend to the prom. First he goes to rent a tux, but there’s a long tux line at the shop and it takes forever.

Next, he has to get some flowers, so he heads over to the florist and there’s a huge flower line there. He waits forever but eventually he buys the flowers.

Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, there’s a large limo line at the rental office, but he’s patient and gets the job done.

Finally, the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and there’s no punchline.

noticed his fly was open, and zipped it up.
He then understood his assistant's question
about his 'garage door.'

door was open, did you see my Hummer parked
in there?'
She smiled and said, 'No, I didn't.

Once upon a time there was a Cheerio.
(long)

This Cheerio dreamed of going to Perfect Cheerio Land, where only the best Cheerios lived. In Perfect Cheerio Land, there was everything a little Cheerio’s heart desired.

One day, when Cheerio woke up, an angel cheerio was at the foot of his bed. The angel said, “I am here to take you to Perfect Cheerio Land, but only for one day.” Cheerio was ecstatic. Finally he would see Perfect Cheerio Land!

Cheerio wanted to have a day packed with fun. First, Cheerio and the angel went to a restaurant. When they arrived, there was a very very very very very long line. So they waited and waited and waited and waited and finally got to the front. 

After they ate their food, Cheerio wanted to go to an amusement park. When Cheerio and the angel arrived, Cheerio said that he wanted to go on the Ferris Wheel. Unfortunately, there was another very very very very very long line. So they waited and waited and waited and waited and finally got to the front. 

After they rode on the Ferris Wheel, Cheerio wanted to go to an arcade. When they arrived, Cheerio said he wanted to play Pac-Man. But Pac-Man was the most popular game on the arcade, so there was a very very very very very long line. So they waited and waited and waited and waited and finally got to the front. 

After Cheerio played Pac-Man, he was very thirsty. He looked around for something to drink, but couldn’t find any drink anywhere. After hours of searching, he stumbled upon a manager and asked him, “Sir, where is the punch line?”

The manager looked up and said, “There is no punch line.”

Three men on their lunch break *LONG*
Three men were working together on the 40th floor construction of the Empire State Building.
An American, an Italian, and a Canadian.

A loud horn is heard signifying lunch, and all three men sat together, on the edge, their feet dangling a hundreds of feet in the air.

The American opens his lunch pail and exclaims loudly, "Hell! Hamburger and french fries again for lunch?? Everyday my wife makes me this. I swear if this happens again tomorrow, I will jump off of here and kill myself!"

The Italian opens his lunch pail "Momma mia! Spaghetti and-a meat-a-balls! Again?! My friend if my wife packs this again I will jump to my death with you!"

The Canadian opens his lunch pail and smirks in disgust. "Aye bai's, if I have to eat a bolgna sandwich again I will jump too. No doobt aboot it!"

The next day, a loud horn is heard on The Empire State Building construction site. The three men sit down on the same spot, legs dangling over the edge.

The American opens his lunch pail, exclaims loudly "FUCK!", and without another word jumps and plummets to his death.

The Italian, looking nervous, peeks inside his lunchpail and lets out a long sigh. Then slides off the edge and plummets 40 floors.

The Canadian opens his lunch pail. Pulls out a bologna sandwich and enjoys his lunch. Stands up, stretches, looks over the city, then jumps to his death.

A week later a funeral is held for the three men. The American wife is bawling her eyes out swearing she will cry whenever she sees a hamburger. The Italian wife is in hysterics swearing to never eat pasta again. The Canadians wife is smoking a cigarette drinking a beer. The other wives ask why she is not mourning her husband.

While we recognize that a lot of hard work has gone into preparing for 2020, if we're honest it has just turned into a bit of a sh*tshow and we feel it best just to call it off.

We understand that some of you were looking forward to seeing what cruel and peculiar clusterf**k of a disaster 2020 would throw up next, but on balance we believe it is probably best not to find out.

We will instead provide ticket holders with a full refund or exchange, and start afresh with 2021 on Monday.

Our plan is to deliver a more enjoyable year, similar to say 2016, which everyone thought was the absolute worst year of all time, but in retrospect was a f**king walk in the park.

See you next year.

A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in California when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, "If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, Will you give me a calf?" 

Bud looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, "Sure, Why not?" 

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.. 

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg , Germany .. 

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.. 

Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, "You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves." 

"That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves," says Bud. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. 

Then Bud says to the young man, "If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?" 

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, "Okay, why not?" 

"You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government", says Bud. 

"Wow! That's correct," says the yuppie, "but how did you guess that?" 

"No guessing required." answered the cowboy. "You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter. 


This is a herd of sheep. .....

Its thanksgiving
A little boy around 4 years old is watching his dad cut the turkey. He accidentally cuts his hand and he yells "fuck." The boy asks his dad what that word means. His dad says it means to cut. 

The boy then goes to the bathroom where his mum is putting on makeup. Her hand slips and she goes "shit," the boy asks what that word means. The mum says it means makeup. 

Then his uncle knocks on the door. The boy opens it and the uncle asks what his parents are doing. The boys says "my dads fucking the turkey and my mums putting shit on her face."

The nun said, "I understand completely."

The soldier added, "I hope I'm not rude, but you have a great pair of legs!"

A woman is pregnant with triplets.
One day, a gangster shot her three times in a stomach for a gang initiation. After spending a few months in the hospital, the doctor declared that she made a mysterious recovery and allowed her to return home. She gave birth to 2 girls and 1 boy. 16 years later, one of her daughters walked into her room carrying a bullet. She explained that it fell out while she was using the bathroom. So her mother explained the story about the gangster. Her second daughter walked in puzzled, also holding a bullet. So her mother explained the story again. Finally, her son entered the room crying. His mom said "Let me guess, you were using the bathroom and a bullet came out?" He said: "No, I was jacking off and shot the dog"

A man walks into a bar...
he leans over and says to the bartender, "Hey, will you give me a free beer if I show you something so amazing that I can guarantee you've never seen it before?"

The bartender says, "Okay, but it had better be good."

The man reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a hamster. He sets the hamster down on the bar. It scurries about, jumps off the end, turns a perfect somersault in midair, and lands on the piano. He then begins to dance across the keys, playing the piano beautifully. 

The bartender says, "Wow! That was truly incredible! Have a beer."

The man finishes his beer and says to the bartender, "Hey, if I show you something else that is so amazing I can guarantee you've never seen before, will you give me another free beer?"

"If it's as amazing as that hamster, then sure," the bartender replies.

So the man reaches into his other coat pocket and pulls out a frog. He sets the frog down on the bar, and the frog begins to sing beautifully. The bartender is again amazed, and the man earns another beer.

As the man is drinking his beer, a guy at the other end of the bar walks over and says, "What a performer! I'll give you $500 for that frog."

The first man says, "It’s a deal!" and sells the guy his frog. The bartender shakes his head slowly. "Not that it's any of my business, mind you, but that was a real, live singing frog. Why would you sell it for only $500? You could have made millions off of it."

The man says, "Nah, don't worry. The hamster's also a ventriloquist."

A man walks into a bar in South Beach and orders a drink. (long)
The bartender and the man make some easy conversation for about 20 minutes, during which the time the man has consumed four beers, and is getting progressively more wasted as time goes on. At this point, the bartender asks the man, "Hey, have you heard of our famous bar challenge?"

The man replies, "What?"

The bartender explains, "Yeah. So what you do is you do a thirty second keg stand and you then have to complete three tasks. If you complete all three tasks, then you win $5,000. It's all safe and totally legal."

The man sees no visible reason to object, so he says, "Sure, why not? How hard can this be?"

"You'll see. The first thing you'll do after your keg stand is eat our famous deluxe double cheeseburger meal with every possible ingredient on the burger and an extra large fries and a shake." 

The man nods, and a smug look crosses his face. *This'll be easy,* he thought to himself. 

"Next up, there's an alligator we've been trying to get rid of that's been lurking behind the bar in the back alley sewer. You'll go through that door to get there. You are allowed to use a baseball bat that's sitting by the door. Kill the alligator and deposit it in the garbage disposal."

The man nods again, this time enthusiastically, and gestures for the bartender to continue.

"For your last challenge, you will go up the back stairs and enter the first door on the left. In that room, a prostitute is waiting for you. Have sex with her and last for ten minutes, and come back down. After all has been completed, you will walk out of here with $5,000 of cold, hard cash. Do you agree to these terms?"

"I agree to your terms," the man replies.

The bartender grins and exclaims, "Great! You have exactly one hour to complete this challenge. Are you ready?"

"Hell yes. Let's DO THIS!!" The man rips his shirt off to reveal his muscular figure in the spirit of drunkenness.

"Okay." The bartender turns and shouts to everyone in the bar, "Great news! We have a participant!!" Cheering ensues from the rest of the bar. The bartender turns back to the man and says, "Time starts... NOW!"

He performs the keg stand, while the entire room full of people cheer him on and count - "TWENTY-SEVEN, TWENTY-EIGHT, TWENTY-NIIIIIINE, THIRTY!!" 

The man ROARS in triumph and starts to demolish the deluxe burger combo, which he polishes off in 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The bartender shouts, "Fifty-one minutes and thirty seconds left to go!" The man, feeling empowered by the people at the bar, storms out the back door. 

Five minutes pass. Then, ten. Fifteen. Twenty. Twenty five. 

FINALLY, at twenty six minutes and three seconds gone by, the man re-enters the building, pants and shoes badly tattered and soaked with sewer water. He's scratched profusely in the chest, and blood is trickling down his entire body. In his drunken state, however, he doesn't seem to notice. He bellows, "ALL RIGHT. WHERE'S THAT DIRTY WHORE I NEED TO BEAT UP WITH A BASEBALL BAT???"

The Coronavirus has shut down theater
Due to social distancing, the Shakespearean Theater Company had to cancel all of their live shows.  Before self-quarantining, they decided to do one last performance of Romeo and Juliet and livestream their production over the internet. In order to reach a wide audience, they advertised there show on dozens of subreddits.

Before the show, they had the costumes, props, and theater disinfected to protect the health of the actors. However, the sanitizing process left the stage dangerously slippery.

Because of the shortage of household supplies, the maintenance team had no paper towels to wipe away the disinfectant, and they almost had to cancel the show. Luckily a stagehand had an idea. He found an old dictionary in the props closet, ripped out its pages, and laid them all down individually to cover the entire stage. This gave the actors just enough traction to safely perform.

The play was steamed tó over 50,000 viewers and went off without a hitch, The next day the producer tracked the stage hand. 

"I owe you a debt l of gratitude! Your idea saved the day! I've been reading reviews online and everybody is raving about how much they enjoyed the show!"

The stagehand nodded confidently and said, "I'm not surprised. Redditors love a good play on words."

Saying goodbye to mother
We were dressed and ready to go out for the New Years Eve Party. We turned on a night light, turned the answering machine on, covered our pet parakeet and put the cat in the backyard. We phoned the local cab company and requested a taxi. The taxi arrived and we opened the front door to leave the house. The cat we put out in the back yard, scoots back into the front door. 

We didn't want the cat shut in the house because she always tries to eat the bird. My wife goes out to the taxi, while I went inside to get the cat. The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit. 

Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn't want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night. So, she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, 'He's just going upstairs to say Goodbye to my mother.' 

A few minutes later, I get into the cab. 'Sorry I took so long,' I said, as we drove away. 'That stupid bitch was hiding under the bed. I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck. Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me. But it worked! I hauled her fat ass downstairs and threw her out into the back yard! 

The cab driver hit a parked car.

The peanut replied, "You need to eat some peanut butter."

And so the man went home and ate some peanut butter. Then the next night he went to the bar again, even though he told himself he would stop because he had such a rough day at work and just wanted a drink. So he walked into the bar and went over to the line for beer, but it was too long. So he decided he would have some whiskey, but yet again the line was too long. He tried for wine, but the line was still too long.

Then he said to himself, "Oh, I know! I'll go have some punch!"

So he walked over to go get some punch, and he realized something: THERE IS NO PUNCH LINE!

Guess they’re going bat-shit crazy

A manager of a small restaurant just discovered that someone in their town tested positive for COVID-19
The manager calls a meeting of his three employees--an Italian, a Scottsman, and a Japanese man.

The manager says to the Italian, "Sanitize everything in the kitchen!"

The manager then says to the Scottsman, "Make new to-go flyers! All our new dishes need to be on there!"

The manager then says to the Japanese man, "You're in charge of supplies!"

He leaves in a panic to check on his family and comes back to the restaurant. When he goes into the kitchen, he sees that everything is absolutely filthy and *nothing* has been cleaned. He asks the Italian, "What happened? Why didn't you clean the kitchen?!"

He replies "I no ave mop! I no ave rags! I no ave soap! You saida to the Japanese guy dat e wasa ina charge of sooplies, but he hasa disappeared and I no coulda finda 'im nowhere."

Frustrated, the manager leaves to check on the new to-go menus, and he sees the Scotsman just sitting there, reading the old menus. "...and you! I thought I told you to create to-go menus!"

He replied, "Aye, ye did lad, but ah couldnae git masel' ony paper o' pens! Ye left tha' wee Jap mannie in charge o' supplies, but ah couldnae fin' him onywhar."

The manager blows his top and storms off into the back of the restaurant to find the Japanese man. He looks in the alleyway, in the bathroom, and as he is walking towards the closet, the door suddenly bursts open! Out jumps the Japanese man and he yells...

Time is money

A reporter heard about a restaurant that claimed to be the most efficient restaurant around, so he decided to take a look for himself. When he got there he noticed right away that they only had male staff. Once he was seated, he asked his waiter, “Why are there only male staff?”. The waiter replied, “Well the owner did a study and apparently male staff have more energy and need to take less breaks, and well time is money.” The reporter wasn’t sure on this but maybe it was true. He went ahead and ordered some soup. While he was eating his soup he happened to drop his spoon. His waiter was nearby and immediately gave him a replacement from his breast pocket. “That was quick!” He said to the waiter. “Do you always have a spare spoon in your breast pocket?” The waiter responded “If you take a look around, all the waiters have spoons in their breast pocket. Apparently the owner did a study and spoons are the most dropped utensil. Knowing this he told us to carry one in our breast pocket so that when a customer drops one, we don’t have to take the time to go back to the kitchen to get another one and well time is money.” The reporter was starting to think wow this owner really knows his stuff because after all I did drop my spoon. He kept eating until he noticed that all the waiters also had a string tied from the breast pocket down to their pants zipper. He called over his waiter and said “So I noticed the string that goes down to your zipper. What’s up with that?”. The waiter was a little embarrassed and said “Well this one is a bit odd and embarrassing to say, but since you’re a reporter I’ll go ahead and tell you. The owner did a study and it takes men about 3 mins to go to the bathroom, wash their hands, and get back to work. He wanted to cut that time in half, so he made us tie the end of the string to the tips of our privates so when we go to the bathroom we just unzip, pull on the string and it comes out. We don’t have to touch it so we don’t have to wash our hands, which saves time and well time is money.” This caught the reporter off guard. “That is the strangest thing I’ve heard, but I suppose it makes sense.” The waiter was about to leave when the reporter said “Wait! I see how you get it out, but ummm how do you get it back in your pants?” The waiter leaned in and said “I don’t know about the rest of the guys, but I use the spoon!”
